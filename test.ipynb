Novel and evolving technologies are introducing advances in treatment options that have the potential to increase access to care for Medicare beneficiaries, improve outcomes, and reduce overall costs to the program. In some cases, these innovative technologies are substituting for more invasive care and/or augmenting the practice of medicine.  Starting in 2018, we began making payment for the SaaS procedure Fractional Flow Reserve Derived from Computed Tomography (FFRCT), also known by the trade name HeartFlow. HeartFlow is a noninvasive diagnostic service that allows physicians to measure coronary artery disease in a patient through the use of coronary CT scans. The HeartFlow SaaS procedure is intended for clinically stable symptomatic patients with coronary artery disease, and, in many cases, its use may eliminate the need for an invasive coronary angiogram procedure. HeartFlow uses a proprietary data analysis process performed at a central facility to develop a three-dimensional image of a patient's coronary arteries, which allows physicians to identify the fractional flow reserve to assess whether patients should undergo further invasive testing (that is, a coronary angiogram). i.e., While HeartFlow was the first SaaS procedure for which we made separate payment under the OPPS, we have since begun paying for other SaaS procedures In CY 2021, we assigned CPT code 92229 (Imaging of retina for detection or monitoring of disease; point-of-care automated analysis and report, unilateral or bilateral), an artificial intelligence system to detect diabetic retinopathy known as IDx-DR to APC 5733 with the status indicator “S” (85 FR 85960 to 85961). IDx-DR uses an artificial intelligence algorithm to review images of a patient's retina to provide a clinical decision as to whether the patient needs to be referred to an eyecare professional for diabetic retinopathy or rescreened in twelve months (negative for mild diabetic retinopathy). Also, in CY 2021, we began paying for CPT code 0615T (Eye-movement analysis without spatial calibration, with interpretation and report), which involves the use of the EyeBOX system as an aid in the diagnosis of concussion. We assigned EyeBOX to APC 5734 with the status indicator “Q1,” to indicate that the code is conditionally packaged when performed with another service on the same day (85 FR 85952 to 85953). Over the past several years, the AMA has established several codes that describe SaaS procedures. HeartFlow, IDx-DR, and the EyeBox System are each described by single CPT codes. But for a procedure known by the tradename LiverMultiScan, the CPT editorial panel created two CPT codes for CY 2022, a primary code and an add-on code: 0648T:e.g.,e.g., 0649T:e.g.,e.g., LiverMultiScan uses clinical software to aid the diagnosis and management of chronic liver disease through analysis using proprietary algorithms of MR images acquired from patients' providers. As described above, the coding for LiverMultiScan is bifurcated into CPT code 0648T, billable when LiverMultiScan is used to analyze already existing images, and CPT add-on code 0649T, describing the LiverMultiScan software analysis, which is adjunctive to the acquisition of the MR images. In accordance with our OPPS policy, we review all new CPT codes and, for those that are payable under the OPPS, we assign them to appropriate APCs and make status indicator assignments for them. In the CY 2022 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period, we assigned CPT code 0648T to New Technology APC 1511 (86 FR 63542). Given the dependent nature and adjunctive characteristics of procedures described by add-on codes and in light of our longstanding OPPS packaging principles, payment for add-on codes is generally packaged into the primary procedure. In the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (78 FR 74942 through 74945) and in the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (79 FR 66817 through 66818), we stated that procedures described by add-on codes represent an extension or continuation of a primary procedure, which means they are ancillary, supportive, dependent, or adjunctive to a primary service. Add-on codes describe services that are always performed in addition to a primary procedure and are never reported as a stand-alone code. Because the second LiverMultiScan code—CPT code 0649T—is an add-on code, in accordance with our current OPPS policy, we packaged payment for it with the primary service with which it is furnished, rather than paying for it separately as we do for the primary LiverMultiScan code—CPT code 0648T (86 FR 63541 through 63543).\", ('SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:', 'X.

Addition of a New Service Category for Hospital Outpatient Department (OPD) Prior Authorization Process', 'B. Controlling Unnecessary Increases in the Volume of Covered OPD Services'): \"In accordance with §\\u2009419.83(b), we propose to require prior authorization for a new service category: Facet Joint Interventions. We propose adding the new service category at §\\u2009419.83(a)(3). We also propose that the prior authorization process for this additional service category would be effective for dates of services on or after March 1, 2023. As explained more fully below, the proposed addition of this service category is consistent with our authority under section 1833(t)(2)(F) of the Act and is based upon our determination that there has been an unnecessary increase in the volume of these services. Because we propose that prior authorization would be required for this service category at a later date than for the first seven service categories, we propose to revise paragraph (a)(3) to include this new service category and reflect the March 1, 2023 implementation date for the prior authorization requirement for this additional service category. Specifically, we propose that paragraph (a)(3) would read, “[t]he Facet Joint Interventions service category requires prior authorization beginning for service dates on or after March 1, 2023.” We also propose that existing paragraph (a)(3) be moved to paragraph (b) and that paragraph (b) be revised by modifying the title to read, “Adoption of the list of services and technical updates.” We also propose to re-designate the current paragraph (b) as subparagraph (b)(1). Subparagraph (b)(1) would read, “CMS will adopt the list of hospital outpatient department service categories requiring prior authorization and any updates or geographic restrictions through formal notice-and-comment rulemaking.” As previously mentioned, current paragraph (a)(3) would be moved to new paragraph (b)(2) and read, “Technical updates to the list of services, such as changes to the name of the service or CPT code, will be published on the CMS website.” The proposed Facet Joint Interventions service category would consist of facet joint injections, medial branch blocks, and facet joint nerve destruction. Facet joint injections are procedures in which a practitioner injects a medication into the facet joints (the connections between the bones of the spine) to help diagnose the cause and location of pain and also to provide pain relief. Medial branch block is a procedure in which a medication is injected near the medial branch nerve connected to a specific facet joint to achieve pain relief. Facet joint nerve destruction (also known as nerve denervation) is a procedure that uses heat to destroy the small area of the facet joint nerve for pain management. We propose that the list of proposed additional OPD services in the Facet Joint Interventions service category that would require prior authorization beginning on March 1, 2023 are those identified by the CPT codes in Table 79. For ease of review and brevity, we only include in the regulation text in proposed new §\\u2009419.83(a)(3) the name of the service category, but not the CPT codes that fall into that service category, which are listed in Table 79. Note that this is the same approach we took in establishing the initial five service categories in §\\u2009419.83(a)(1) and two additional service categories in §\\u2009419.83(a)(2). For ease of reference, we have included the 2020 Final List of Outpatient Services that Require Prior Authorization for the five initial service categories and the 2021 Final List of Outpatient Services that Require Prior Authorization for two additional service categories in Table 80. Again, we propose that the prior authorization process for the proposed additional service category would be effective for dates of service on or after March 1, 2023. We propose an effective date slightly earlier in the calendar year (compared to the July 1, 2020 and July 1, 2021 effective dates for the services categories previously added to the prior authorization regulation) because Medicare Contractors, CMS, and the OPD providers already have knowledge of and experience with the prior authorization process. Also, this new service category can be performed by some of the same provider types who furnish other services currently subject to the OPD prior authorization process, such as implanted spinal neurostimulators and cervical fusion with disc removal.  In proposing the addition of this new service category, we reviewed approximately 1 billion claims related to OPD services during the 10-year period from 2012 through 2021. We determined that the overall rate of OPD claims submitted for payment to the Medicare program increased each year by an average rate of 0.6 percent. This equated to an increase from approximately 105 million OPD claims submitted for payment in 2012 to approximately 111 million claims submitted for payment in 2021. The 0.6 percent rate reflects a decrease when compared to the 2.8 percent rate identified in the CY 2021 OPPS/ASC proposed rule, when we looked at the period from 2007 through 2018. Our analysis also showed an average annual rate-of-increase in the Medicare allowed amount (the amount that Medicare would pay for services regardless of external variables, such as beneficiary plan differences, deductibles, and appeals) of 4.2 percent. Again, this is a decrease when compared to the 7.8 percent rate identified in the CY 2021 OPPS/ASC proposed rule for a slightly earlier timeframe. The decrease in the average annual increase in the claim volume and allowed amount from the increases noted in the CY 2021 OPPS/ASC proposed rule is likely due in part to the PHE as discussed in more detail below. We found that the total Medicare allowed amount for the OPD services claims processed in 2012 was approximately $48 billion and increased to $73 billion in 2021, while during this same 10-year period, the average annual increase in the number of Medicare beneficiaries per year was only 0.4 percent.  https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Computer-Data-and-Systems/IDR/index.html When analyzing the data, we took the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (PHE) into consideration. As a result of the PHE, healthcare use and spending dropped sharply due to cancellations of elective and non-emergency care to increase hospital capacity and social distancing measures to reduce the community spread of the coronavirus. Consequently, the claims data for CY 2020 showed a significant decrease in volume compared to the previous year, which is likely due to the PHE. However, over the 9-year period of our analysis, services for facet joint interventions demonstrated increases. These volume increases led us to further research the reasons behind them, to determine if they were unnecessary.  https://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region9/92003003.asp https://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region9/92103002.asp https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/16-defendants-including-12-physicians-sentenced-prison-distributing-66-million-opioid-pills      https://www.medicare.gov/care-compare345\\u2009346\\u2009347\\u2009348\\u2009349\\u2009350\\u2009351  https://www.cms.gov//newsroom//fact-sheets//first-release-overall-hospital-quality-star-rating-hospital-compare.    qualitynet.orghttps://qualitynet.org/inpatient/public-reporting/overall-ratings/resources#tab2 qualitynet.orghttps://qualitynet.org/inpatient/public-reporting/overall-ratings/resources#tab2 www.qualitynet.orghttps://qualitynet.org/outpatient/public-reporting/overall-ratings/resources qualitynet.orghttps://qualitynet.org/inpatient/public-reporting/overall-ratings/resources#tab2 In this proposed rule, we are: (1) providing information on the previously finalized policy for inclusion of quality measure data from Veteran's Health Administration (VHA) hospitals; (2) proposing to amend the language of §\\u2009412.190(c) to state that we would use publicly available measure results on Hospital Compare or its successor websites from a quarter within the prior twelve months; and (3) conveying that although CMS intends to publish Overall Hospital Quality Star Ratings in 2023, we may apply the suppression policy if applicable.  • The HAI-1 and HAI-2 measures were first publicly reported for VHA hospitals in July 2021, but only included one quarter of measure data. Therefore, we chose to use the next public reporting, April 2022, which included four quarters of these measures' data. • For the PSI 04 and PSI 90 measures, we used measure data that was publicly reported in July 2021. VHA hospitals first publicly reported these measures in October 2020; however, a different software was used for the measure calculations than the software used to calculate subsection (d) hospitals and CAHs measure data. We chose to use measure data publicly reported in 2021 for better comparison. • For the OP-22 measure, VHA hospitals began submitting their measure data in January 2021 for public reporting. • For the HIP/KNEE measures (total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthoroplasty (TKA)), we used measure data that was publicly reported in October 2020. This data did not initially include VHA hospitals, so we recalculated to include them. The recalculated results including VHA hospitals was not publicly reported until July 2021. Using these data from the internal analysis, we compared 2021 Overall Hospital Quality Star Ratings scores for non-VHA hospitals before and after adding VHA hospitals to Overall Hospital Quality Star Ratings. 119 out of 171 VHA hospitals met the requirements to receive a Star Rating. This increased the number of hospitals receiving a star rating from 3,355 to 3,474. The distribution of Star Ratings was nearly identical for VHA and non-VHA hospitals. As part of the Overall Hospital Quality Star Ratings methodology, hospitals are assigned to peer groups based on the number of measure groups with at least three measures. Peer group assignments were similar across VHA and non-VHA hospitals. In Peer Group 3, assignments were 12 percent VHA vs. 10 percent non-VHA; in Peer Group 4, assignments were 25 percent VHA vs. 16 percent non-VHA; and in Peer Group 5, assignments were 63 percent VHA vs. 74 percent non-VHA). 3,119 (93 percent) non-VHA hospitals maintained the same number of stars after adding VHA hospitals to 2021 Overall Hospital Quality Star Ratings. For the 236 non-VHA hospitals with a different star rating, 23 gained a star and 213 lost a star. No hospital gained or lost more than one star. As with any update to either the underlying measures or the Overall Hospital Quality Star Ratings methodology, we expect that some hospitals would shift star rating categories. However, for this internal analysis, over 90 percent of non-VHA hospitals did not experience a change in their Overall Hospital Quality Star Ratings score, which is consistent with prior changes to the measures or methodology in our experience. As previously finalized, we intend to include VHA hospitals in future Overall Hospital Quality Star Ratings. We are also proposing to amend our policy regarding the data periods used to refresh Overall Hospital Quality Star Ratings. In the CY 2021 OPPS final rule with comment period, we stated that “we would use publicly available measure results on Hospital Compare or its successor websites from a quarter within the prior year” to refresh Overall Hospital Quality Star Ratings (85 FR 86202). Since adopting that policy, it has come to our attention that this wording could be confusing. We intended for the phrase “within the prior year” to refer to any time within the prior 12 months, and not to a Care Compare refresh from the prior calendar year. Therefore, we are proposing to change §\\u2009412.190 (c) to state “The Overall Star Rating are published once annually using data publicly reported on Hospital Compare or its successor website from a quarter within the previous 12 months.” For example, for the Overall Hospital Quality Star Ratings in July 2023, we would use any Care Compare refreshes from the previous 12 months: July 2023, April 2023, January 2022, October 2022, or July 2022. We invite public comments on this proposal.  www.qualitynet.orghttps://qualitynet.org/inpatient/public-reporting/overall-ratings/resources#tab1 www.qualitynet.orghttps://qualitynet.org/outpatient/public-reporting/overall-ratings/resources We recognize that there may be some concerns with publishing Overall Hospital Quality Star Ratings if the underlying measures reflect some aspect of extenuating circumstances, for example, skewed data or performance related to treating patients with COVID-19. However, we want to balance that with providing important quality information to Medicare beneficiaries and the public during times when hospital care is critical. The goal of the Overall Hospital Quality Star Ratings is to summarize hospital quality information in a way that is simple and easy for patients to understand to increase transparency and empower patients to make more informed decisions about their healthcare. i.e., https://www.cms.gov/files/document/guidance-memo-exceptions-and-extensions-quality-reporting-and-value-based-purchasing-programs.pdf If a measure is considered valid and reliable enough to be reported on Care Compare then it meets the criteria to be included in Overall Hospital Quality Star Ratings calculations (85 FR 86193 through 86236). This remains true even for measures that were suppressed in certain programs due to the impact of COVID-19 (86 FR 45301 through 45304). Consistent with this policy, we will continue to include measures in the Overall Hospital Quality Star Ratings that might have been suppressed in the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing, Hospital-Acquired Condition Reduction, and Hospital Readmissions Reduction Programs but are still publicly reported (86 FR 44778 through 44779). In the CY 2021 OPPS/ASC rule with comment period (85 FR 48996 through 49027), we finalized that we will allow for suppression, but only in limited circumstances. Specifically, for the Overall Hospital Quality Star Rating beginning with the CY 2021 and for subsequent years, we adopted a policy that we would consider suppressing the Overall Star Rating only under extenuating circumstances that affect numerous hospitals (as in, not an individualized or localized issue) as determined by CMS or when CMS is at fault, including but not limited to when— • There is an Overall Star Rating calculation error by CMS; • There is a systemic error at the CMS quality program level that substantively affects the Overall Hospital Star Rating calculation. For example, there is a CMS quality program level error for one or more measures included within the Overall Star Rating due to incorrect data processing or measure calculations that affects a substantial number of hospitals reporting those measures. We note that we would strive to first correct systemic errors at the program level per program policies and then recalculate the Overall Star Rating, if possible; or • A Public Health Emergency substantially affects the underlying measure data. This is codified at §\\u2009412.190(f)(1). Although CMS intends to publish the Overall Hospital Quality Star Rating in 2023, CMS may exercise the authority described above should the COVID-19 PHE substantially affect the underlying measure data. The Addenda to the OPPS/ASC proposed rules and the final rules with comment period are published and available via the internet on the CMS website. In the CY 2019 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (83 FR 59154), for CY 2019, we changed the format of the OPPS Addenda A, B, and C, by adding a column titled “Copayment Capped at the Inpatient Deductible of $1,364.00” where we flag, through use of an asterisk, those items and services with a copayment that is equal to or greater than the inpatient hospital deductible amount for any given year (the copayment amount for a procedure performed in a year cannot exceed the amount of the inpatient hospital deductible established under section 1813(b) of the Act for that year). For CY 2023, we propose to retain these columns, updated to reflect the amount of the 2023 inpatient deductible. In the CY 2022 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (85 FR 86266), we updated the format of the OPPS Addenda A, B, and C by adding a column titled “Drug Pass-Through Expiration during Calendar Year” where we flagged through the use of an asterisk, each drug for which pass-through payment was expiring during the calendar year on a date other than December 31. For CY 2023, we propose to retain these columns that are updated to reflect the drug codes for which pass-through payment is expiring in CY 2023. In addition, for CY 2023, we propose to update a column titled “Drug Pass-Through Expiration during Calendar Year” to include devices, so that the column reads “Drug and Device Pass-Through Expiration during Calendar Year” where we propose to flag through the use of an asterisk, each drug and device for which pass-through payment would be expiring during the calendar year on a date other than December 31. http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/HospitalOutpatientPPS/Hospital-Outpatient-Regulations-and-Notices.htmlhttp://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/ASCPayment/ASC-Regulations-and-Notices.html Federal Register • The need for the information collection and its usefulness in carrying out the proper functions of our agency. • The accuracy of our estimate of the information collection burden. • The quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected. • Recommendations to minimize the information collection burden on the affected public, including automated collection techniques.  The Hospital Outpatient Quality Reporting (OQR) Program is generally aligned with the CMS quality reporting program for hospital inpatient services known as the Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting (IQR) Program. We refer readers to the CY 2011 through CY 2022 OPPS/ASC final rules (75 FR 72111 through 72114; 76 FR 74549 through 74554; 77 FR 68527 through 68532; 78 FR 75170 through 75172; 79 FR 67012 through 67015; 80 FR 70580 through 70582; 81 FR 79862 through 79863; 82 FR 59476 through 59479; 83 FR 59155 through 59156; 84 FR 61468 through 61469; 85 FR 86266 through 86267; and 86 FR 63961 through 63968, respectively) for detailed discussions of the previously finalized Hospital OQR Program ICRs. The ICRs associated with the Hospital OQR Program are currently approved under OMB control number 0938-1109, which expires on February 28, 2025. In the CY 2022 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period, our burden estimates were based on an assumption of 3,300 hospitals (86 FR 63961). For this proposed rule, we propose to update our assumption to 3,350 hospitals based on recent data from the CY 2022 payment determination which reflects a closer approximation of the total number of hospitals reporting data for the Hospital OQR Program.  https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes292072.htm In section XV.B.4 of this proposed rule, we propose to: (1) change the Cataracts: Improvement in Patient's Visual Function within 90 days Following Cataract Surgery measure (OP-31) to voluntary beginning with the CY 2025 reporting period/CY 2027 payment determination; (2) add an additional targeting criterion to the validation selection policy beginning with the CY 2023 reporting period; and (3) align the patient encounter quarters with the calendar year and update the data submission deadlines for each of these quarters beginning with the Q2 2023 reporting period. In the CY 2022 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (86 FR 63845 through 63846), we finalized to require this measure with mandatory reporting beginning with the CY 2025 reporting period/CY 2027 payment determination. We previously finalized voluntary reporting of this measure in the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (79 FR 66947 through 66948) and estimated that 20 percent of hospitals would elect to report it annually (79 FR 67014). As discussed in section XV.B.5.b of this proposed rule, we propose to change this measure to voluntary beginning with the CY 2025 reporting period/CY 2027 payment determination. We continue to estimate it will require hospitals 10 minutes once annually to report this measure using a CMS web-based tool. As a result of this proposal, we estimate only 20 percent of hospitals would voluntarily submit data, which results in a total annual burden estimate of 112 hours (3,350 hospitals × 20 percent × 0.1667 hours) at a cost of $5,188 (112 hours × $46.46/hour). In addition to reporting the measure, for hospitals that chose to voluntarily submit, we also require hospitals to perform chart abstraction and estimate that each hospital would spend 2.92 minutes (0.049 hours) per case per measure to perform this activity. In the CY 2022 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period, we used an estimate of 25 minutes per case per measure (86 FR 63963). Upon review, this estimate was erroneous, therefore we are correcting our assumption to 2.92 minutes (0.049 hours) per case per measure as finalized in the CY 2016 OPPS/ASC final rule (80 FR 70582). The currently approved burden estimate assumes 242 cases per measure. For chart abstraction, we estimate an annual burden of 12 hours (0.049 hours × 242 cases) at a cost of $549 (12 hours × $46.46/hour) per hospital and a total annual burden of 7,891 hours (3,350 hospitals × 20 percent × 12 hours) at a cost of $368,028 (7,891 hours × $46.46/hour) for all participating hospitals. In aggregate, we estimate a total annual burden of 8,003 hours (112 hours + 7,891 hours) at a cost of $373,216 ($5,188 + $368,028) for all hospitals. This is a decrease of 325,847 hours and $15,138,852 per year from the currently approved estimate due to the 80 percent of hospitals we assume will no longer report this measure, the updated assumption of the number of hospitals participating in the Hospital OQR Program, the updated burden estimate for chart abstraction, and the updated wage rate. The information collection requirement and the associated burden will be submitted as part of a revision of the information collection request currently approved under OMB control number 0938-1109, which expires on February 28, 2025.  In section XV.B.4.b of this proposed rule, we propose to align patient encounter quarters with the calendar year (January through December), beginning with the CY 2026 payment determination and subsequent years. We do not anticipate that this proposal, if finalized, would result in any increase in information collection burden because it would not change the amount of data hospitals would be required to submit. In summary, under OMB control number 0938-1109 which expires on February 28, 2025 we estimate that the updated assumptions and proposals in this proposed rule will result in a decrease of 325,847 hours annually for 3,350 OPPS hospitals for the CY 2025 reporting period/CY 2027 payment determination and subsequent years. The total cost decrease related to this information collection is approximately -$15,138,852 (325,847 hours × $46.46/hour) (which also reflects use of an updated hourly wage rate as previously discussed). Table 81 summarizes the estimated total burden change compared to our currently approved information collection burden estimates. We will submit the revised information collection estimates to OMB for approval under OMB control number 0938-1109. We are not proposing any changes for the CY 2024 reporting period/CY 2026 payment determination, therefore the previously finalized burden estimates for the CY 2024 reporting period/CY 2026 payment determination remain unchanged. We refer readers to the CY 2012 OPPS/ASC final rule (76 FR 74554), the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (77 FR 53672), and the CY 2013, CY 2014, CY 2015, CY 2016, CY 2017, CY 2018, CY 2019, CY 2020, CY 2021, and CY 2022 OPPS/ASC final rules (77 FR 68532 through 68533; 78 FR 75172 through 75174; 79 FR 67015 through 67016; 80 FR 70582 through 70584; 81 FR 79863 through 79865; 82 FR 59479 through 59481; 83 FR 59156 through 59157; 84 FR 61469; 85 FR 86267; and 86 FR 63968 through 63971, respectively) for detailed discussions of the Ambulatory Surgical Center Quality Reporting (ASCQR) Program ICRs we have previously finalized. The ICRs associated with the ASCQR Program for the CY 2014 through CY 2023 payment determinations are currently approved under OMB control number 0938-1270, which expires on July 31, 2024.  https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes292072.htm Based on an analysis of the CY 2020 payment determination data, we found that of the 6,651 ASCs that met eligibility requirements for the ASCQR Program, 3,494 were required to participate in the Program and did so. In addition, 689 ASCs that were not required to participate due to having low Medicare claims volume (less than 240), did so, for a total of 4,183 participating facilities. As noted in section XXV.C.5.a of the “Regulatory Impact Analysis” of this proposed rule, for the CY 2021 payment determination, all 6,811 ASCs that met eligibility requirements for the ASCQR Program received the annual payment update due to data submission requirements being excepted under the ASCQR Program's ECE policy in consideration of the COVID-19 PHE; 3,957 of these ASCs would have been required to participate without the PHE exception. Therefore, we estimate that 3,957 plus 689, or 4,646, ASCs will submit data for the ASCQR Program for the CY 2023 payment determination unless otherwise noted. In section XV.B.4 of this proposed rule, we propose to change the Cataracts: Improvement in Patient's Visual Function within 90 days Following Cataract Surgery measure (ASC-11) to voluntary beginning with the CY 2025 reporting period/CY 2027 payment determination. In the CY 2022 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (86 FR 63886 through 63887), we finalized to require this measure with mandatory reporting beginning with the CY 2025 reporting period/CY 2027 payment determination. We previously finalized voluntary reporting of this measure in the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (79 FR 66985) and estimated that 20 percent of ASCs would elect to report it annually (79 FR 67016). As discussed in section XV.B.5.b of this proposed rule, we propose to change the ASC-11 measure to voluntary beginning with the CY 2025 reporting period/CY 2027 payment determination. We continue to estimate it will require ASCs 10 minutes once annually to report this measure using a CMS web-based tool. As a result of this proposal, we estimate only 20 percent of ASCs would voluntarily submit data, which results in a total annual burden estimate for all participating ASCs of 155 hours (4,646 ASCs × 20 percent × 0.1667 hours) at a cost of $7,194 (115 hours × $46.46/hour). In addition to reporting the measure, for ASCs that chose to voluntarily submit, we also require ASCs to perform chart abstraction for a minimum required sample size of 63 cases. In the CY 2022 OPPS/ASC final rule, we estimated that each ASC would spend 15 minutes (0.25 hours) per case to perform this activity (86 FR 63969). However, upon review, we believe the effort involved with this activity is similar to what is required for the OP-31 measure in the Hospital OQR Program, therefore, we are updating our assumption to 2.92 minutes (0.049 hours) per case per measure. Therefore, we estimate an annual burden of 3.1 hours (0.049 hours × 63 cases) at a cost of $142 (3.1 hours × $46.46/hour) per ASC and a total annual burden of 2,848 hours (4,646 ASCs × 20 percent × 3.1 hours) at a cost of $132,333 (2,848 hours × $46.46/hour) for all participating ASCs. In aggregate, we estimate a total annual burden of 3,003 hours (155 hours + 2,848 hours) at a cost of $139,527 ($7,194 + $132,333) for all ASCs. This is a decrease of 72,107 hours and $3,350,091 per year from the currently approved estimate due to the 80 percent of ASCs we assume would no longer report this measure, the updated burden estimate per case per measure, and the updated wage rate. In summary, under OMB control number 0938-1270 which expires on July 31, 2024, we estimate that the policies promulgated in this proposed rule would result in a decrease of 72,107 hours annually for 4,646 ASCs for the CY 2025 reporting period/CY 2027 payment determination and subsequent years. The total cost decrease related to this information collection is approximately $3,350,091 (72,107 hours × $46.46/hour). Table 82 summarizes the total burden change compared to our currently approved information collection burden estimates. We will submit the revised information collection estimates to OMB for approval under OMB control number 0938-1270. As discussed in section XVIII.E of this proposed rule, we propose to revise certain existing exceptions applicable to compensation arrangements involving specific types of providers to make them applicable to compensation arrangements to which an REH is a party. Specifically, we propose to revise the exceptions for physician recruitment at §\\u2009411.357(e), obstetrical malpractice insurance subsidies at §\\u2009411.357(r), retention payments in underserved areas at §\\u2009411.357(t), electronic prescribing items and services at §\\u2009411.357(v), assistance to compensate a nonphysician practitioner at §\\u2009411.357(x), and timeshare arrangements at §\\u2009411.357(y) to also permit an REH to provide remuneration to a physician (or an immediate family member of a physician) if all requirements of the applicable exception are satisfied. All of the proposed revisions would ensure that exceptions that may already be utilized by existing hospitals eligible to undergo conversion to an REH remain available to REHs. bona fide While the writing, signature, and record retention requirements are subject to the PRA, we believe the associated burden is exempt under 5 CFR 1320.3(b)(2). We believe that the time, effort, and financial resources necessary to comply with these requirements would be incurred by persons without Federal regulation during the normal course of their activities. Specifically, we believe that, for normal business operations purposes, health care providers and suppliers document their financial arrangements with physicians and others and retain these documents in order to identify and be able to enforce the legal obligations of the parties. Therefore, we believe that the writing, signature, and record retention requirements should be considered usual and customary business practices.   In accordance with §\\u2009419.83(b), we propose to require prior authorization for a new service category: Facet Joint Interventions. We propose adding the service category to §\\u2009419.83(a)(3). We also propose that the prior authorization process for the additional service category would be effective for dates of services on or after March 1, 2023. The ICR associated with prior authorization requests for these covered outpatient department services is the required documentation submitted by providers. The prior authorization request must include all relevant documentation necessary to show that the service meets applicable Medicare coverage, coding, and payment rules and the request must be submitted before the service is provided to the beneficiary and before the claim is submitted for processing. The burden associated with the prior authorization process for the new category, Facet Joint Interventions, will be the time and effort necessary for the submitter to locate and obtain the relevant supporting documentation to show that the service meets applicable coverage, coding, and payment rules, and to forward the information to CMS or its contractor (MAC) for review and determination of a provisional affirmation. We expect that this information will generally be maintained by providers within the normal course of business and that this information will be readily available. We estimate that the average time for office clerical activities associated with this task will be 30 minutes, which is equivalent to that for normal prepayment or post payment medical review. We anticipate that most prior authorization requests will be sent by means other than mail. However, we estimate a cost of $5 per request for mailing medical records. Due to the proposed March 1, 2023 start date, the first year of the prior authorization for the new service category would only include 10 months. Based on CY 2019 data, we estimate that for those first 10 months there would be 69,501 initial requests mailed during the year. In addition, we estimate there would be 22,805 resubmissions of a request mailed following a non-affirmed decision. Therefore, the total mailing cost is estimated to be $461,532 (92,306 mailed requests × $5). Based on CY 2019 data for the new service category, we estimate that annually there would be 83,401 initial requests mailed during a year. In addition, we estimate there would be 27,366 resubmissions of a request mailed following a non-affirmed decision. Therefore, the total annual mailing cost is estimated to be $553,838 (110,786 mailed requests × $5). We also estimate that an additional 3 hours per provider would be required for attending educational meetings, training staff on what services require prior authorization, and reviewing training documents. The average labor costs (including 100 percent fringe benefits) used to estimate the costs were calculated using data available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Based on the BLS information, we estimate an average clerical hourly rate of $17.13 with a loaded rate of $34.26. The prior authorization program for the new service category would not create any new documentation or administrative requirements. Instead, it would just require the same documents needed to support claim payments to be submitted earlier in the claim process. The estimate uses the clerical rate since we do not believe that clinical staff would need to spend more time on completing the documentation than would be needed in the absence of the prior authorization policy. The hourly rate reflects the time needed for the additional clerical work of submitting the prior authorization request itself. CMS believes providers would have provided education to their staff on what services are included in the prior authorization process. Following this education, the staff would know which services need prior authorization and would not need additional time or resources to determine if a service requires prior authorization. We estimate that the total number of submissions for the first year (10 months) will be 307,688 (215,382 submissions through fax or electronic means + 92,306 mailed submissions). Therefore, we estimate that the total burden for the first year (10 months) for the new service category, allotted across all providers, would be 161,305 hours (.5 hours × 307,688 submissions plus 3 hours × 2,487 providers for education). The burden cost for the first year (10 months) is $5,987,841 (161,305 hours × $34.26 plus $461,532 for mailing costs). In addition, we estimate that the total annual number of submissions would be 369,225 (258,458 submissions through fax or electronic means + 110,768 mailed submissions). The annual burden hours for the new service category, allotted across all providers, would be 192,074 hours (.5 hours × 369,225 submissions plus 3 hours × 2,487 providers for education). The annual burden cost would be $7,134,276 (192,074 hours × $34.26 plus $553,838 for mailing costs). For the total burden and associated costs for the new service category, we estimate the annualized burden to be 181,818 hours and $6,752,131 million. The annualized burden is based on an average of 3 years, that is, 1 year at the 10-month burden and 2 years at the 12-month burden. The ICR approved under OMB control number 0938-1368 would be revised and submitted to OMB for approval. Table 83 below is a chart reflecting the total burden and associated costs for the provisions included in this proposed rule. In section X.H of this proposed rule, we propose IPPS and OPPS payment adjustments for the additional resource costs of domestic NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators for cost reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023. The proposed payment adjustments would be based on the IPPS and OPPS shares of the estimated difference in the reasonable costs of a hospital to purchase domestic NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators compared to non-domestic ones. As discussed in section X.H of this proposed rule, in order to calculate the N95 payment adjustment for each eligible cost reporting period, we propose to create a new cost report form to collect additional information from hospitals. Specifically, we propose to collect the following: (1) total quantity of domestic NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators purchased by hospital; (2) total aggregate cost of domestic NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators purchased by hospital; (3) total quantity of non-domestic NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators purchased by hospital; and (4) total aggregate cost of non-domestic NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators purchased by hospital. This information would be used along with other information already collected on the cost report to calculate an IPPS payment adjustment amount and an OPPS payment adjustment amount. This new cost report worksheet may be submitted by a provider of service as part of the annual filing of the cost report and make available to its contractor and CMS, documentation to substantiate the data included on this Medicare cost report worksheet. These proposed documentation requirements are based on the recordkeeping requirements at current §\\u2009413.20, which require providers of services to maintain sufficient financial records and statistical data for proper determination of costs payable under Medicare. The burden associated with this proposal would be the time and effort necessary for the provider to locate and obtain the relevant supporting documentation to report the quantity and aggregate costs of domestic NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators and non-domestic NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators purchased by hospital for the period.

In addition to the announcement in this rule, we will also be publishing the required 60-day and 30-day notices to formally announce the aforementioned resubmission request and to both inform the public on where to find the revised PRA package for review and where to submit comments. Federal RegisterDATES This proposed rule is necessary to make updates to the Medicare hospital OPPS rates. It is necessary to make changes to the payment policies and rates for outpatient services furnished by hospitals and CMHCs in CY 2023. We are required under section 1833(t)(3)(C)(ii) of the Act to update annually the OPPS conversion factor used to determine the payment rates for APCs. We also are required under section 1833(t)(9)(A) of the Act to review, not less often than annually, and revise the groups, the relative payment weights, and the wage and other adjustments described in section 1833(t)(2) of the Act. We must review the clinical integrity of payment groups and relative payment weights at least annually. We propose to revise the APC relative payment weights using claims data for services furnished on and after January 1, 2021, through and including December 31, 2021, and processed through December 31, 2021, and June 2020 HCRIS information with cost reporting periods prior to the PHE, as discussed in section X.B of this proposed rule with comment period.  In the CY 2019 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (83 FR 59075 through 59079), we finalized a policy to update the ASC payment system rates using the hospital market basket update instead of the CPI-U for CY 2019 through 2023. We believed that this policy would help stabilize the differential between OPPS payments and ASC payments, given that the CPI-U has been generally lower than the hospital market basket, and encourage the migration of services to lower cost settings as clinically appropriate. In this proposed rule we are also requesting information on possible alternative methodologies for counting organs for transplant hospitals and organ procurement organizations to calculate Medicare's share of organ acquisition costs, but we are not making any proposals at this time. We propose to exclude research organs from total usable organs used in the calculation of Medicare's share of organ acquisition costs and require a cost offset, but we are unable to estimate the extent to which the research organ proposal may impact the cost of research organs and the costs to Medicare. We also propose to clarify that certain costs associated with cardiac death are covered as organ acquisition costs but we do not anticipate an impact from this proposal. Therefore, there is no impact from the organ acquisition proposals in this proposed rule. We have examined the impacts of this proposed rule, as required by Executive Order 12866 on Regulatory Planning and Review (September 30, 1993), Executive Order 13563 on Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review (January 18, 2011), the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (September 19, 1980, Pub. L. 96-354), section 1102(b) of the Social Security Act, section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (March 22, 1995, Pub. L. 104-4), Executive Order 13132 on Federalism (August 4, 1999), and the Congressional Review Act (5 U.S.C. 804(2)). This section of this proposed rule contains the impact and other economic analyses for the provisions we propose for CY 2023. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 defines a “significant regulatory action” as an action that is likely to result in a rule: (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more in any 1 year, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as “economically significant”); (2) creating a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. Executive Order 13563 emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This proposed rule has been designated as an economically significant rule under section 3(f)(1) of Executive Order 12866 and hence also a major rule under Subtitle E of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (also known as the Congressional Review Act).” Accordingly, this proposed rule has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. We have prepared a regulatory impact analysis that, to the best of our ability, presents the costs and benefits of the provisions of this proposed rule. We are soliciting public comments on the regulatory impact analysis in this proposed rule, and we will address any public comments we receive in the final rule with comment period, as appropriate. We estimate that the total increase in Federal Government expenditures under the OPPS for CY 2023, compared to CY 2022, due only to the proposed changes to the OPPS in this proposed rule, would be approximately $1.79 billion. Taking into account our estimated changes in enrollment, utilization, and case-mix for CY 2023, we estimate that the OPPS expenditures, including beneficiary cost-sharing, for CY 2023 would be approximately $86.2 billion, which is approximately $6.2 billion higher than estimated OPPS expenditures in CY 2022. Because the provisions of the OPPS are part of a proposed rule that is economically significant, as measured by the threshold of an additional $100 million in expenditures in 1 year, we have prepared this regulatory impact analysis that, to the best of our ability, presents its costs and benefits. Table 84 of this proposed rule displays the distributional impact of the CY 2023 changes in OPPS payment to various groups of hospitals and for CMHCs. We note that we formally propose for CY 2023 that drugs and biologicals that are acquired under the 340B Program would be paid at ASP minus 22.5 percent, WAC minus 22.5 percent, or 69.46 percent of AWP, as applicable. The impacts on hospital rates as a result of this formal proposal are reflected in the discussion of the estimated effects of this proposed rule. However, we fully expect to revert to our previous policy of paying ASP plus 6 percent for drugs acquired under the 340B program and anticipate budget neutralizing the increase in payments for these drugs consistent with our longstanding policy of offsetting increases or decreases in particular payments through an adjustment to the OPPS conversion factor. We estimate that the proposed update to the conversion factor and other budget neutrality adjustments would increase total OPPS payments by 2.7 percent in CY 2023. The proposed changes to the APC relative payment weights, the proposed changes to the wage indexes, the proposed continuation of a payment adjustment for rural SCHs, including EACHs, the formal proposed continuation of payment policy for separately payable drugs acquired under the 340B program, and the proposed payment adjustment for cancer hospitals would not increase total OPPS payments because these changes to the OPPS are budget neutral. However, these updates would change the distribution of payments within the budget neutral system. We estimate that the total change in payments between CY 2022 and CY 2023, considering all budget-neutral payment adjustments, changes in estimated total outlier payments, pass-through payments, the application of the frontier State wage adjustment, in addition to the application of the OPD fee schedule increase factor after all adjustments required by sections 1833(t)(3)(F), 1833(t)(3)(G), and 1833(t)(17) of the Act, the proposed exception for rural sole community hospitals from the clinic visit policy when provided at off-campus provider based departments, and the proposed payment adjustment for the additional resource costs for domestic NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators would increase total estimated OPPS payments by 2.9 percent.  http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/HospitalOutpatientPPS/index.html We estimate the effects of the individual policy changes by estimating payments per service, while holding all other payment policies constant. We use the best data available, but do not attempt to predict behavioral responses to our policy changes in order to isolate the effects associated with specific policies or updates, but any policy that changes payment could have a behavioral response. In addition, we have not made any adjustments for future changes in variables, such as service volume, service-mix, or number of encounters. In section V.B of this proposed rule, we discuss our formal proposal to adjust the payment amount for nonpass-through, separately payable drugs acquired by certain 340B participating hospitals through the 340B Program. Rural SCHs, children's hospitals, and PPS-exempt cancer hospitals which we propose continue to be excepted from this payment policy in CY 2023. Specifically, in this proposed rule for CY 2023, for hospitals paid under the OPPS (other than those that are proposed to be excepted for CY 2023), we formally propose to pay for separately payable drugs and biologicals that are obtained with a 340B discount, excluding those on pass-through payment status and vaccines, at ASP minus 22.5 percent. Because we formally propose to continue current Medicare payment policy for CY 2022, the budget neutrality adjustment does not reflect a change as a result of the 340B drug payment policy.  American Hospital Association, American Hospital Ass'nBecerra As discussed in section X.H of the preamble of this proposed rule, we propose IPPS and OPPS payment adjustments for the additional resource costs that hospitals incur in procuring domestic NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators. We propose that the payment adjustments would commence for cost reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023. For the IPPS, we propose to make this payment adjustment for the additional resource costs of domestic NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators under section 1886(d)(5)(I) of the Act. To further support the strategic policy goal of sustaining a level of supply resilience for domestic NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators that is critical to protect the health and safety of personnel and patients in a public health emergency, we are not proposing to make the IPPS payment adjustment budget neutral under the IPPS. The data currently available to calculate a spending estimate for CY 2023 under the IPPS is limited. However, we believe the methodology described next to calculate this spending estimate under the IPPS for CY 2023 is reasonable based on the information available. To calculate the estimated total spending associated with this policy under the IPPS we multiplied together estimates of the following: Estimate of the total number of NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators used in the treatment of IPPS patients in CY 2023.  Estimate of the percentage of NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators used in the treatment of IPPS patients in CY 2023 that are domestic. For purposes of this estimate, we believe it is reasonable to assume that on average approximately one NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirator is used for every day a beneficiary is in the hospital. The FY 2021 MedPAR claims data used for ratesetting in the FY 2023 IPPS/LTCH proposed rule accounted for approximately 7.2 million IPPS discharges and 38.3 million Medicare covered days. Therefore, for CY 2023, we are estimating that the total number of NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators (both domestic and non-domestic) used in the treatment of IPPS patients will be 38.3 million. Based on available data, our best estimate of the difference in the average unit costs of domestic and non-domestic NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators is $0.20. It is particularly challenging to estimate the percentage of NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators that will be used in the treatment of IPPS patients in CY 2023 that will be domestic. The OMB's Made in America Office recently conducted a data call on capacity in which several entities attested to being able to supply 3.6 billion NIOSH-approved and Berry-compliant surgical N95 respirators annually in the future if there were sufficient demand. We recognize that it may take time for this capacity to be fully reflected in hospital purchases. Therefore, although this would be sufficient capacity to supply the entire hospital industry if it were to be available and focused on this segment of the marketplace in 2023, we believe it is reasonable to assume that this will not happen instantaneously and hospitals in aggregate may in fact be able to purchase less than half of their NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators as domestic in 2023. Therefore, for purposes of this IPPS spending estimate, we set the percentage of NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators used in the treatment of IPPS patients in CY 2023 that are domestic to 40 percent, or slightly less than half. We estimate that total CY 2023 IPPS payments associated with this policy will be $3.1 million (or 38.3 million covered days * $0.20 * 40 percent). For the OPPS, we propose to make this payment adjustment for the additional resource costs of domestic NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators under section 1833(t)(2)(E) of the Act, which authorizes the Secretary to establish, in a budget neutral manner, other adjustments as determined to be necessary to ensure equitable payments. Consistent with this authority, the proposed OPPS payment adjustment would be budget neutral. In section X.H of the preamble of this proposed rule, we estimate that total CY 2023 OPPS payments associated with this policy will be $8.3 million. This represents approximately 0.01 percent of the OPPS, which we propose to budget neutralize through an adjustment to the OPPS conversion factor. Table 84 shows the estimated impact of this proposed rule on hospitals. Historically, the first line of the impact table, which estimates the change in payments to all facilities, has always included cancer and children's hospitals, which are held harmless to their pre-Balanced Budget Act (BBA) amount. We also include CMHCs in the first line that includes all providers. We include a second line for all hospitals, excluding permanently held harmless hospitals and CMHCs. We present separate impacts for CMHCs in Table 84, and we discuss them separately below, because CMHCs are paid only for partial hospitalization services under the OPPS and are a different provider type from hospitals. In CY 2023, we propose to continue to pay CMHCs for partial hospitalization services under APC 5853 (Partial Hospitalization for CMHCs) and to pay hospitals for partial hospitalization services under APC 5863 (Partial Hospitalization for Hospital-Based PHPs). The estimated increase in the total payments made under the OPPS is determined largely by the increase to the conversion factor under the statutory methodology. The distributional impacts presented do not include assumptions about changes in volume and service-mix. The conversion factor is updated annually by the OPD fee schedule increase factor, as discussed in detail in section II.B of this proposed rule. Section 1833(t)(3)(C)(iv) of the Act provides that the OPD fee schedule increase factor is equal to the market basket percentage increase applicable under section 1886(b)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act, which we refer to as the IPPS market basket percentage increase. The proposed IPPS market basket percentage increase applicable to the OPD fee schedule for CY 2023 is 3.1 percent. Section 1833(t)(3)(F)(i) of the Act reduces that 3.1 percent by the productivity adjustment described in section 1886(b)(3)(B)(xi)(II) of the Act, which is 0.4 percentage point for CY 2023 (which is also the productivity adjustment for FY 2023 in the FY 2023 IPPS/LTCH PPS proposed rule (87 FR 28403)), resulting in the CY 2023 OPD fee schedule increase factor of 2.7 percent. We propose to use the OPD fee schedule increase factor of 2.7 percent in the calculation of the CY 2023 OPPS conversion factor. Section 10324 of the Affordable Care Act, as amended by HCERA, further authorized additional expenditures outside budget neutrality for hospitals in certain frontier States that have a wage index less than 1.0000. The amounts attributable to this frontier State wage index adjustment are incorporated in the estimates in Table 84 of this proposed rule. To illustrate the impact of the CY 2023 changes, our analysis begins with a baseline simulation model that uses the CY 2022 relative payment weights, the FY 2022 final IPPS wage indexes that include reclassifications, and the final CY 2022 conversion factor. Table 84 shows the estimated redistribution of the increase or decrease in payments for CY 2023 over CY 2022 payments to hospitals and CMHCs as a result of the following factors: the impact of the APC reconfiguration and recalibration changes between CY 2022 and CY 2023 (Column 2); the wage indexes and the provider adjustments (Column 3); the combined impact of all of the changes described in the preceding columns plus the 2.7 percent OPD fee schedule increase factor update to the conversion factor (Column 4); the estimated differential impact of the proposed rural SCH exception to the Off Campus Provider Based Department Visits Policy (Column 5); the estimated impact taking into account all payments for CY 2023 relative to all payments for CY 2022, including the impact of changes in estimated outlier payments, changes to the pass-through payment estimate, the proposed change to except rural sole community hospitals from the clinic visit policy when provided at campus provider based departments, and the proposed payment adjustment for the additional resource costs to hospitals of acquiring domestic NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators (Column 6).  Overall, we estimate that the rates for CY 2023 would increase Medicare OPPS payments by an estimated 2.9 percent. Removing payments to cancer and children's hospitals because their payments are held harmless to the pre-OPPS ratio between payment and cost and removing payments to CMHCs results in an estimated 3.0 percent increase in Medicare payments to all other hospitals. These estimated payments would not significantly impact other providers. The first line in Column 1 in Table 84 shows the total number of facilities (3,502), including designated cancer and children's hospitals and CMHCs, for which we were able to use CY 2021 hospital outpatient and CMHC claims data to model CY 2022 and CY 2023 payments, by classes of hospitals, for CMHCs and for dedicated cancer hospitals. We excluded all hospitals and CMHCs for which we could not plausibly estimate CY 2022 or CY 2023 payment and entities that are not paid under the OPPS. The latter entities include CAHs, all-inclusive hospitals, and hospitals located in Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, and the State of Maryland. This process is discussed in greater detail in section II.A. of this proposed rule. At this time, we are unable to calculate a DSH variable for hospitals that are not also paid under the IPPS because DSH payments are only made to hospitals paid under the IPPS. Hospitals for which we do not have a DSH variable are grouped separately and generally include freestanding psychiatric hospitals, rehabilitation hospitals, and long-term care hospitals. We show the total number of OPPS hospitals (3,411), excluding the hold-harmless cancer and children's hospitals and CMHCs, on the second line of the table. We excluded cancer and children's hospitals because section 1833(t)(7)(D) of the Act permanently holds harmless cancer hospitals and children's hospitals to their “pre-BBA amount” as specified under the terms of the statute, and therefore, we removed them from our impact analyses. We show the isolated impact on the 25 CMHCs at the bottom of the impact table (Table 84) and discuss that impact separately below. Column 2 shows the estimated effect of APC recalibration. Column 2 also reflects any changes in multiple procedure discount patterns or conditional packaging that occur as a result of the changes in the relative magnitude of payment weights. As a result of APC recalibration, we estimate that urban hospitals will experience a 0.1 increase, with the impact ranging from a decrease of 0.3 percent to an increase of 0.6, depending on the number of beds. Rural hospitals will experience an estimated decrease of 0.1 overall. Major teaching hospitals will experience an estimated increase of 0.4 percent. Column 3 demonstrates the combined budget neutral impact of the APC recalibration; the updates for the wage indexes with the FY 2023 IPPS post-reclassification wage indexes; the rural adjustment; the frontier adjustment, and the cancer hospital payment adjustment. We modeled the independent effect of the budget neutrality adjustments and the OPD fee schedule increase factor by using the relative payment weights and wage indexes for each year, and using a CY 2022 conversion factor that included the OPD fee schedule increase and a budget neutrality adjustment for differences in wage indexes. Column 3 reflects the independent effects of the updated wage indexes, including the application of budget neutrality for the rural floor policy on a nationwide basis, as well as the proposed CY 2023 changes in wage index policy discussed in section II.C this proposed rule. We did not model a budget neutrality adjustment for the proposed rural adjustment for SCHs because we propose to continue the rural payment adjustment of 7.1 percent to rural SCHs for CY 2023, as described in section II.E of this proposed rule. We also did not model a budget neutrality adjustment for the proposed cancer hospital payment adjustment because the proposed payment-to-cost ratio target for the cancer hospital payment adjustment in CY 2023 is 0.89, the same as the ratio that was reported for the CY 2022 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (85 FR 85914). We note that, in accordance with section 16002 of the 21st Century Cures Act, we are applying a budget neutrality factor calculated as if the cancer hospital adjustment target payment-to-cost ratio was 0.90, not the 0.89 target payment-to-cost ratio we are applying in section II.F of this proposed rule. We modeled the independent effect of updating the wage indexes by varying only the wage indexes, holding APC relative payment weights, service-mix, and the rural adjustment constant and using the CY 2023 scaled weights and a CY 2022 conversion factor that included a budget neutrality adjustment for the effect of the changes to the wage indexes between CY 2022 and CY 2023. Column 4 demonstrates the combined impact of all of the changes previously described and the update to the conversion factor of 2.7 percent. Overall, these changes will increase payments to urban hospitals by 3.0 percent and to rural hospitals by 2.6 percent. Sole community hospitals receive an estimated increase of 2.5 percent while other rural hospitals receive an estimated increase of 2.6 percent. Column 5 displays the estimated effect of including the volume control method to pay for clinic visit HCPCS code G0463 ((Hospital outpatient clinic visit for assessment and management of a patient) when billed with modifier “PO” by an excepted off-campus PBD at a rate that would continue be 40 percent of the OPPS rate for a clinic visit service for CY 2023. Based on our proposal to apply an exception to this policy for rural sole community hospitals in the CY 2023 OPPS, the column includes estimated increases in payment, which are non-budget neutral.  Of those hospitals that failed to meet the Hospital OQR Program reporting requirements for the full CY 2022 update (and assumed, for modeling purposes, to be the same number for CY 2023), we included 33 hospitals in our model because they had both CY 2021 claims data and recent cost report data. We estimate that the cumulative effect of all changes for CY 2023 will increase payments to all facilities by 2.9 percent for CY 2022. We modeled the independent effect of all changes in Column 6 using the final relative payment weights for CY 2022 and the proposed relative payment weights for CY 2023. We used the proposed conversion factor for CY 2023 of $86.785 and the final CY 2022 conversion factor of $84.177 discussed in section II.B of this proposed rule. Column 6 contains simulated outlier payments for each year. We used the 1-year charge inflation factor used in the FY 2021 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (87 FR 28667) of 6.4 percent (1.06404) to increase charges on the CY 2021 claims, and we used the overall CCR in the April 2022 Outpatient Provider-Specific File (OPSF) to estimate outlier payments for CY 2022. Using the CY 2021 claims and a 6.4 percent charge inflation factor, we currently estimate that outlier payments for CY 2022, using a multiple threshold of 1.75 and a fixed-dollar threshold of $6,175, will be approximately 1.29 percent of total payments. The estimated current outlier payments of 1.29 percent are incorporated in the comparison in Column 5. We used the same set of claims and a charge inflation factor of 13.2 percent (1.13218) and the CCRs in the April 2022 OPSF, with an adjustment of 0.974495 (86 FR 25718), to reflect relative changes in cost and charge inflation between CY 2021 and CY 2023, to model the proposed CY 2023 outliers at 1.0 percent of estimated total payments using a multiple threshold of 1.75 and a fixed-dollar threshold of $8,350. The charge inflation and CCR inflation factors are discussed in detail in the FY 2023 IPPS/LTCH PPS proposed rule (87 FR 28666 through 28667). Overall, we estimate that facilities would experience an increase of 2.9 percent under this proposed rule in CY 2023 relative to total spending in CY 2022. This projected increase (shown in Column 6) of Table 84 of this proposed rule reflects the 2.7 percent OPD fee schedule increase factor, plus 0.34 percent for the change in the pass-through payment estimate between CY 2022 and CY 2023, the proposed change to except rural sole community hospitals from the clinic visit policy when provided at excepted off-campus provider-based departments, and the proposed adjustment for the additional resource costs of acquiring domestic NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators, minus the difference in estimated outlier payments between CY 2022 (1.29 percent) and CY 2023 (1.0 percent). We estimate that the combined effect of all proposed changes for CY 2023 would increase payments to urban hospitals by 2.9 percent. Overall, we estimate that rural hospitals would experience a 3.2 percent increase as a result of the combined effects of all the proposed changes for CY 2023. Among hospitals, by teaching status, we estimate that the impacts resulting from the combined effects of all changes would include an increase of 2.6 percent for major teaching hospitals and an increase of 3.3 percent for nonteaching hospitals. Minor teaching hospitals would experience an estimated increase of 3.0 percent. In our analysis, we also have categorized hospitals by type of ownership. Based on this analysis, we estimate that voluntary hospitals would experience an increase of 2.9 percent, proprietary hospitals would experience an increase of 3.5 percent, and governmental hospitals would experience an increase of 2.8 percent. We note that under our anticipated alternative policy in which 340B-acquired drugs would be paid at ASP+6 percent that providers would experience different estimated changes based on the alternative policy. Under the anticipated alternative OPPS, the combined effect of all proposed changes for CY 2023 would increase payments to urban hospitals by 4.0 percent. Overall, we estimate that, under the anticipated alternative, rural hospitals would experience a 2.1 percent increase as a result of the combined effects of all the proposed changes for CY 2023. Among hospitals, by teaching status, under the anticipated alternative, we estimate that the impacts resulting from the combined effects of all changes would include an increase of 5.9 percent for major teaching hospitals and an increase of 2.3 percent for nonteaching hospitals. Under the anticipated alternative, minor teaching hospitals would experience an estimated increase of 3.5 percent. In our analysis, we also have categorized hospitals by type of ownership. Based on this analysis, under the anticipated alternative, we estimate that voluntary hospitals would experience an increase of 4.0 percent, proprietary hospitals would experience an increase of 0.5 percent, and governmental hospitals would experience an increase of 4.9 percent. For more information on the changes associated with the anticipated alternative OPPS policy, please see the supporting data files associated with the alternative policy on the CMS website. The last line of Table 84 demonstrates the isolated impact on CMHCs, which furnish only partial hospitalization services under the OPPS. In CY 2022, CMHCs are paid under APC 5853 (Partial Hospitalization (3 or more services) for CMHCs). We modeled the impact of this APC policy assuming CMHCs will continue to provide the same number of days of PHP care as seen in the CY 2021 claims used for ratesetting in the proposed rule. We excluded days with 1 or 2 services because our policy only pays a per diem rate for partial hospitalization when 3 or more qualifying services are provided to the beneficiary. We estimate that CMHCs would experience an overall 8.4 percent decrease in payments from CY 2022 (shown in Column 6). We note that this includes the trimming methodology as well as the proposed CY 2023 geometric mean costs used for developing the PHP payment rates described in section VIII. of this proposed rule. Column 3 shows the estimated impact of adopting the proposed FY 2023 wage index values would result in an increase of 0.2 percent to CMHCs. Column 4 shows that combining the OPD fee schedule increase factor, along with proposed changes in APC policy for CY 2023 and the proposed FY 2023 wage index updates, will result in an estimated decrease of 8.7 percent. Column 6 shows that adding the changes in outlier and pass-through payments would result in a total −8.4 percent decrease in payment for CMHCs. This reflects all proposed changes for CMHCs for CY 2023. For services for which the beneficiary pays a copayment of 20 percent of the payment rate, the beneficiary's payment would increase for services for which the OPPS payments will rise and will decrease for services for which the OPPS payments will fall. For further discussion of the calculation of the national unadjusted copayments and minimum unadjusted copayments, we refer readers to section II.H of this proposed rule. In all cases, section 1833(t)(8)(C)(i) of the Act limits beneficiary liability for copayment for a procedure performed in a year to the hospital inpatient deductible for the applicable year. We estimate that the aggregate beneficiary coinsurance percentage would be 17.8 percent for all services paid under the OPPS in CY 2023. The estimated aggregate beneficiary coinsurance reflects general system adjustments, including the proposed CY 2023 comprehensive APC payment policy discussed in section II.A.2.b of this proposed rule. We note that the individual payments, and therefore copayments, associated with services may differ based on the setting in which they are furnished. However, at the aggregate system level, we do not currently observe significant impact on beneficiary coinsurance as a result of those policies. The relative payment weights and payment amounts established under the OPPS affect the payments made to ASCs, as discussed in section XIII of this proposed rule. No types of providers or suppliers other than hospitals, CMHCs, and ASCs would be affected by the changes in this proposed rule. The effect on the Medicare program is expected to be an increase of $1.8 billion in program payments for OPPS services furnished in CY 2023. The effect on the Medicaid program is expected to be limited to copayments that Medicaid may make on behalf of Medicaid recipients who are also Medicare beneficiaries. We estimate that the changes in this proposed rule would increase these Medicaid beneficiary payments by approximately $115 million in CY 2023. Currently, there are approximately 10 million dual-eligible beneficiaries, which represent approximately thirty percent of Medicare Part B fee-for-service beneficiaries. The impact on Medicaid was determined by taking 30 percent of the beneficiary cost-sharing impact. The national average split of Medicaid payments is 57 percent Federal payments and 43 percent State payments. Therefore, for the estimated $115 million Medicaid increase, approximately $65 million would be from the Federal Government and $50 million would be from State governments. Alternatives to the OPPS changes we propose and the reasons for our selected alternatives are discussed throughout this proposed rule. • Alternatives Considered for the Claims Data used in OPPS and ASC Ratesetting due to the PHE. We refer readers to section X.B of this proposed rule for a discussion of our proposed policy of using cost report data prior to the PHE. We note that in that section we discuss the alternative proposal we are considering regarding applying the standard ratesetting process, in particular the selection of cost report data used, which would include claims and cost report data including the timeframe of the PHE. We note that there are potential issues related to that data, including the effect of the PHE on the provider departmental CCRs that would be used to estimate cost. In this proposed rule, as discussed in section X.D, we propose a policy of using updated CY 2021 claims data in CY 2023 OPPS ratesetting, while using cost report CCRs with reporting periods prior to the PHE. We note that these policy considerations also have ASC implications since the relative weights for certain surgical procedures performed in the ASC setting are developed based on the OPPS relative weights and claims data. • Alternative Considered for the Proposed Adjustment for Acquisition of Domestic NIOSH-approved Surgical N95 Respirators.  Most ASC payment rates are calculated by multiplying the ASC conversion factor by the ASC relative payment weight. As discussed fully in section XIII of this proposed rule, we are setting the CY 2023 ASC relative payment weights by scaling the proposed CY 2023 OPPS relative payment weights by the proposed ASC scalar of 0.8474. The estimated effects of the proposed updated relative payment weights on payment rates are varied and are reflected in the estimated payments displayed in Tables 85 and 86. Beginning in CY 2011, section 3401 of the Affordable Care Act requires that the annual update to the ASC payment system (which, in CY 2019, we adopted a policy to be the hospital market basket update for CY 2019 through CY 2023) after application of any quality reporting reduction be reduced by a productivity adjustment. Section 1886(b)(3)(B)(xi)(II) of the Act defines the productivity adjustment to be equal to the 10-year moving average of changes in annual economy-wide private nonfarm business multifactor productivity (as projected by the Secretary for the 10-year period, ending with the applicable fiscal year, year, cost reporting period, or other annual period). For ASCs that fail to meet their quality reporting requirements, the CY 2023 payment determinations would be based on the application of a 2.0 percentage point reduction to the annual update factor, which would be the hospital market basket update for CY 2023. We calculated the CY 2023 ASC conversion factor by adjusting the CY 2022 ASC conversion factor by 1.0010 to account for changes in the pre-floor and pre-reclassified hospital wage indexes between CY 2022 and CY 2023 and by applying the CY 2023 productivity-adjusted hospital market basket update factor of 2.7 percent (which is equal to the projected hospital market basket update of 3.1 percent reduced by a productivity adjustment of 0.4 percentage point). The CY 2023 ASC conversion factor is $51.315 for ASCs that successfully meet the quality reporting requirements. Presented here are the projected effects of the proposed changes for CY 2023 on Medicare payment to ASCs. A key limitation of our analysis is our inability to predict changes in ASC service-mix between CY 2021 and CY 2023 with precision. We believe the net effect on Medicare expenditures resulting from the proposed CY 2023 changes would be small in the aggregate for all ASCs. However, such changes may have differential effects across surgical specialty groups, as ASCs continue to adjust to the payment rates based on the policies of the revised ASC payment system. We are unable to accurately project such changes at a disaggregated level. Clearly, individual ASCs would experience changes in payment that differ from the aggregated estimated impacts presented below. Some ASCs are multispecialty facilities that perform a wide range of surgical procedures from excision of lesions to hernia repair to cataract extraction; others focus on a single specialty and perform only a limited range of surgical procedures, such as eye, digestive system, or orthopedic procedures. The combined effect on an individual ASC of the proposed update to the CY 2023 payments would depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the mix of services the ASC provides, the volume of specific services provided by the ASC, the percentage of its patients who are Medicare beneficiaries, and the extent to which an ASC provides different services in the coming year. The following discussion includes tables that display estimates of the impact of the proposed CY 2023 updates to the ASC payment system on Medicare payments to ASCs, assuming the same mix of services, as reflected in our CY 2021 claims data. Table 85 depicts the estimated aggregate percent change in payment by surgical specialty or ancillary items and services group by comparing estimated CY 2022 payments to estimated CY 2023 payments, and Table 86 shows a comparison of estimated CY 2022 payments to estimated CY 2023 payments for procedures that we estimate would receive the most Medicare payment in CY 2022. In Table 85, we have aggregated the surgical HCPCS codes by specialty group, grouped all HCPCS codes for covered ancillary items and services into a single group, and then estimated the effect on aggregated payment for surgical specialty and ancillary items and services groups. The groups are sorted for display in descending order by estimated Medicare program payment to ASCs. The following is an explanation of the information presented in Table 85. • Column 1—Surgical Specialty or Ancillary Items and Services Group indicates the surgical specialty into which ASC procedures are grouped and the ancillary items and services group which includes all HCPCS codes for covered ancillary items and services. To group surgical procedures by surgical specialty, we used the CPT code range definitions and Level II HCPCS codes and Category III CPT codes, as appropriate, to account for all surgical procedures to which the Medicare program payments are attributed. • Column 2—Estimated CY 2022 ASC Payments were calculated using CY 2021 ASC utilization data (the most recent full year of ASC utilization) and CY 2022 ASC payment rates. The surgical specialty and ancillary items and services groups are displayed in descending order based on estimated CY 2022 ASC payments. • Column 3—Estimated CY 2023 Percent Change is the aggregate percentage increase or decrease in Medicare program payment to ASCs for each surgical specialty or ancillary items and services group that is attributable to proposed updates to ASC payment rates for CY 2023 compared to CY 2022.  Table 85 shows the estimated impact of the updates to the revised ASC payment system on aggregate ASC payments for selected surgical procedures during CY 2023. The table displays 30 of the procedures receiving the greatest estimated CY 2022 aggregate Medicare payments to ASCs. The HCPCS codes are sorted in descending order by estimated CY 2022 program payment. • Column 1—CPT/HCPCS code. • Column 2—Short Descriptor of the HCPCS code. • Column 3—Estimated CY 2022 ASC Payments were calculated using CY 2021 ASC utilization (the most recent full year of ASC utilization) and the CY 2022 ASC payment rates. The estimated CY 2022 payments are expressed in millions of dollars. • Column 4—Estimated CY 2023 Percent Change reflects the percent differences between the estimated ASC payment for CY 2022 and the estimated payment for CY 2023 based on the proposed update.  https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/assets/OMB/circulars/a004/a-4.html We refer readers to the CY 2018 OPPS/ASC final rule (82 FR 59492 through 59494) for the previously estimated effects of changes to the Hospital Outpatient Quality Reporting (OQR) Program for the CY 2018, CY 2019, and CY 2021 payment determinations. Of the 3,356 hospitals that met eligibility requirements for the CY 2022 payment determination, we determined that 88 hospitals did not meet the requirements to receive the full annual Outpatient Department (OPD) fee schedule increase factor. We do not anticipate that the CY 2023 Hospital OQR Program proposed policies will impact the number of facilities that will receive payment reductions. In this proposed rule, we propose to—(1) add an additional targeting criterion to the validation selection policy beginning with the CY 2023 reporting period; (2) align the patient encounter quarters with the calendar year beginning with the CY 2024 reporting period; and (3) change reporting for the OP-31 measure from mandatory to voluntary beginning with the CY 2025 payment determination.  In section XV of this proposed rule, we discuss our proposed policies affecting the Ambulatory Surgical Center Quality Reporting (ASCQR) Program. For the CY 2022 payment determination, of the 5,386 ASCs that met eligibility requirements, we determined that 290 ASCs did not meet the requirements to receive the full annual payment update under the ASC fee schedule. In section XVI of this proposed rule, we propose to change reporting for the ASC-11 measure from mandatory to voluntary beginning with the CY 2023 reporting period. As shown in Table 82 in section XXIII.C.3.e (Collection of Information), we estimate a total information collection burden decrease for 4,646 ACSs of −72,107 hours at a cost of −$3,350,091 annually associated with our proposed policies and updated burden estimates for the CY 2025 reporting period/CY 2027 payment determination and subsequent years, compared to our currently approved information collection burden estimates. We refer readers to section XXIII.C of the preamble of this proposed rule (information collection requirements) for a detailed discussion of the calculations estimating the changes to the information collection burden for submitting data to the ASCQR Program. We do not believe the proposed policy will have any further economic impact beyond information collection burden. In section XVIII.A of this proposed rule, we discuss our proposed policies to provide payment to REHs, including the following proposals: (1) the payment rate for an REH service would be calculated using the OPPS prospective payment rate for the equivalent covered OPD service increased by 5 percent; (2) the additional 5 percent payment for REH services, above the amount that would be paid for covered OPD services, would not be subject to a copayment; (3) For CY 2023, the monthly facility payment that each REH will receive would be determined by first calculating the total amount that CMS determines was paid to all CAHs under Title 18 of the Act in CY 2019 minus the estimated total amount that would have been paid under Title 18 to CAHs in CY 2019 if payment were made for inpatient hospital, outpatient hospital, and skilled nursing facility services under the applicable prospective payment systems for such services during CY 2019. The difference is divided by the number of CAHs enrolled in Medicare in CY 2019 to calculate the annual amount of this additional facility payment per individual REH. The annual payment amount is then divided by 12 to calculate the monthly facility payment that each REH will receive.  Findings Brief—NC Rural Health Research Program. We developed a percentile analysis estimating how much revenue from rendering medical services a provider would lose or gain during CY 2023 if it decided to convert to a REH. We estimated that a provider in the 95th percentile of total annual REH medical service payment would receive an additional $2,089,700 in Medicare payments. We estimated that a provider in the 100th percentile of total annual REH medical service payment would receive an additional $3,362,560 in Medicare payments. Since a REH provider conversion rate of 4 percent falls between the 95th percentile and the 100th percentile of total annual REH medical service payment spending, we took the average of the additional spending for the 95th and 100th percentiles to determine the additional medical service spending for each provider converting to a REH in CY 2023 would be $2,726,130. Since we do not have any information on individual providers that may convert, nor do we have any information on characteristics of regions where REH conversions may be more likely, our best assumption regarding the impact of the REH policy is that providers who anticipate the most financial benefit from converting to an REH would be the most likely providers to convert. Next, we determined the annual facility payment amount for a provider that converts to an REH in CY 2023. The proposed monthly facility payment for CY 2023 is $268,294. When this amount is multiplied by 12 months, the total annual facility payment is equal to $3,219,524. To determine the total impacts of the REH policy, we need to multiply the additional medical service spending amount of $2,726,130 by 68 providers which equals $185,376,820. Next, we multiply the total annual facility payment amount of $3,219,524 by 68 providers which equals $218,927,610. Finally, we combine the two amounts together, and we obtain a final estimate of the impacts of the REH provider policy of an additional $404,304,430 in Medicare payments. The physician self-referral law provisions related to REHs are discussed in section XVII.E. of this proposed rule. As discussed in section XVIII.E.3 of this proposed rule, we propose a new exception at §\\u2009411.356(c)(4) for ownership or investment interests held by physicians (or immediate family members of physicians) in an REH. If all the requirements of the proposed exception are satisfied, the physician's (or immediate family member's) ownership or investment interest in the REH would not constitute a financial relationship for purposes of the physician self-referral law, and the referral and billing prohibitions of the physician self-referral law would not apply.  As discussed in section XVIII.E.5 of this proposed rule, we also propose to revise certain existing exceptions applicable to compensation arrangements involving specific types of providers to make them applicable to compensation arrangements to which an REH is a party. Specifically, we propose to revise the exceptions for physician recruitment at §\\u2009411.357(e), obstetrical malpractice insurance subsidies at §\\u2009411.357(r), retention payments in underserved areas at §\\u2009411.357(t), electronic prescribing items and services at §\\u2009411.357(v), assistance to compensate a nonphysician practitioner at §\\u2009411.357(x), and timeshare arrangements at §\\u2009411.357(y) to also permit an REH to provide remuneration to a physician (or an immediate family member of a physician) if all requirements of the applicable exception are satisfied. All the proposed revisions would ensure that exceptions that may already be used by existing CAHs and small rural hospitals eligible to undergo conversion to an REH remain available to REHs. We believe that the continued availability of these exceptions could be important to ensuring access to necessary designated health services and other care furnished by an REH. The only impacts of our proposed REH enrollment policies are the information collection requirements associated with the facility's completion and submission of a Form CMS-855A change of information application to convert from a CAH or hospital (as defined in section 1886(d)(1)(B) of the Act) to an REH. These are addressed in detail in section XXIII.G of this proposed rule. As explained in that section, we estimate a Year 1 burden of 68 hours (68 applications × 1 hour per application) at a cost of $2,784 (based on an hourly wage estimate of $40.94). Over a 3-year period, this results in an annual burden of 23 hours at a cost of $928.   In accordance with §\\u2009419.83(b), we propose to require prior authorization for a new service category: Facet Joint Interventions. We propose adding the service category to §\\u2009419.83(a)(3). We also propose that the prior authorization process for the additional service category would be effective for dates of services on or after March 1, 2023. The addition of the service category is consistent with our authority under section 1833(t)(2)(F) of the Act and is based upon our determination that there has been an unnecessary increase in the volume of these services. The overall economic impact on the health care sector to require prior authorization for the additional service category is dependent on the number of claims affected. Table 90, Overall Economic Impact on the Health Sector, lists an estimate of the overall economic impact on the health sector for the new service category. The values populating this table were obtained from the cost reflected in Table 91, Annual Private Sector Costs, and Table 92, Estimated Annual Administrative Costs to CMS. Together, Tables 91 and 92 combine to convey the overall economic cost impact to the health sector for the new service category, which is illustrated in Table 90. It should be noted that due to the March start date for prior authorization for the new service category, year one includes only 10 months of prior authorization requests. Based on the estimate, the overall economic cost impact would be approximately $22 million in the first year based on 10 months for the new service category. The 5-year impact would be approximately $127.4 million, and the 10-year impact would be approximately $259.2 million. The 5- and 10-year impacts account for year one, including only 10 months. Additional administrative paperwork costs to private sector providers and an increase in Medicare spending to conduct reviews combine to create the financial impact; however, this impact is offset by Medicare savings. Annually, we estimate an overall Medicare savings of $65.3 million. We believe there are likely to be other benefits that would result from the prior authorization requirement for the new service category, though many of those benefits are difficult to quantify. For instance, we would expect to see savings in the form of reduced unnecessary utilization, fraud, waste, and abuse, including a reduction in improper Medicare fee-for-service payments (we note that not all improper payments are fraudulent). We are soliciting public comments on the potential increased costs and benefits associated with this proposed provision for the new service category. According to the RFA's use of the term, most suppliers and providers are small entities. Likewise, the vast majority of physician and nurse practitioner (NP) practices are considered small businesses according to the SBA's size standards of having total revenues of $10 million or less in any 1 year. While the economic costs and benefits are substantial in the aggregate, the economic impact on individual entities compliant with Medicare program coverage and utilization rules and regulations would be relatively small. We estimate that 90 to 95 percent of providers who provide these services are small entities under the RFA definition. The rationale behind requiring prior authorization is to control unnecessary increases in the volume of covered OPD services. The impact on providers not in compliance with Medicare coverage, coding, and payment rules and regulations could be significant, as the proposed rule would change the billing practices of those providers. We believe that the purpose of the statute and this rule is to avoid unnecessary increases in utilization of OPD services. Therefore, we do not view decreased revenues from the additional OPD service category subject to unnecessary utilization by providers to be a condition that we must mitigate. We believe that the effect would be minimal on providers who are compliant with Medicare coverage, coding, and payment rules and requirements. Adding the new service category would offer additional protection to a provider's cash flow as the provider would know in advance if the Medicare requirements are met. We do not believe that this rule would significantly affect the number of legitimate claims submitted for the new service category. However, we would expect a decrease in the overall amount paid for the services resulting from a reduction in unnecessary utilization of the services requiring prior authorization. We estimate that the private sector's per-case time burden attributed to submitting documentation and associated clerical activities in support of a prior authorization request for the additional service category would be equivalent to that of submitting documentation and clerical activities associated with prepayment review, which is 0.5 hours. We would apply this time burden estimate to initial submissions and resubmissions. CMS would incur additional costs associated with processing the prior authorization requests for the new service category. We use the range of potentially affected cases (submissions and resubmissions) and multiply it by $50, the estimated cost to review each request. The combined cost also includes other elements such as appeals, education, outreach, and system changes. We would expect a reduction in the utilization of the new Medicare OPD service category when such utilization does not comply with one or more of Medicare's coverage, coding, and payment rules. While there may be an associated burden on beneficiaries while they wait for the prior authorization decision; we are unable to quantify that burden. Although the rule would permit utilization that is medically necessary, OPD services that are not medically necessary may still provide convenience or usefulness for beneficiaries; any rule-induced loss of such convenience or usefulness constitutes a cost of the rule that we lack data to quantify. Additionally, beneficiaries may have out-of-pocket costs for those services that are determined not to comply with Medicare requirements and thus, are not eligible for Medicare payment. We lack the data to quantify these costs as well.  If regulations impose administrative costs on private entities, such as the time needed to read and interpret a rule, we should estimate the cost associated with regulatory review. Due to the uncertainty involved with accurately quantifying the number of entities that will review a rule, we assumed that the number of commenters on last year's proposed rule (18,664) will be the number of reviewers of this proposed rule. We acknowledge that this assumption may understate or overstate the costs of reviewing this rule. It is possible that not all commenters reviewed last year's rule in detail, and it is also possible that some reviewers choose not to comment on the proposed rule. For these reasons we thought that the number of past commenters would be a fair estimate of the number of reviewers of this rule. We welcome any comments on the approach to estimating the number of entities that will review the proposed rule. We also recognize that different types of entities are, in many cases, affected by mutually exclusive sections of the proposed rule, and therefore, for the purposes of our estimate, we assume that each reviewer reads approximately 50 percent of the rule. We seek comments on this assumption. https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm http://www.sba.gov/content/table-small-business-size-standards In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act requires us to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a rule may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis must conform to the provisions of section 603 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital as a hospital that is located outside of a metropolitan statistical area and has 100 or fewer beds. We estimate that this final rule with comment period would increase payments to small rural hospitals by approximately 3 percent. Therefore, it should not have a significant impact on the approximately 563 small rural hospitals. We note that the estimated payment impact for any category of small entity will depend on both the services that they provide as well as the payment policies and/or payment systems that may apply to them. Therefore, the most applicable estimated impact may be based on the specialty, provider type, or payment system. The analysis above, together with the remainder of this preamble, provides a regulatory flexibility analysis and a regulatory impact analysis. We note that the policies established in this proposed rule apply more broadly to OPPS providers and do not specifically focus on small rural hospitals. As a result, the impact on those providers may depend more significantly on their case mix of services provided, since the broader impact on the hospital category is more dependent on the OPD update factor, as indicated in the impact table. Section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) also requires that agencies assess anticipated costs and benefits before issuing any rule whose mandates require spending in any 1 year of $100 million in 1995 dollars, updated annually for inflation. In 2022, that threshold level is currently approximately $165 million. This proposed rule does not mandate any requirements for State, local, or tribal governments, or for the private sector. The changes we propose in this proposed rule would affect all classes of hospitals paid under the OPPS as well as affect both CMHCs and ASCs. We estimate that most classes of hospitals paid under the OPPS would experience a modest increase or a minimal decrease in payment for services furnished under the OPPS in CY 2023. Table 84 demonstrates the estimated distributional impact of the OPPS budget neutrality requirements that would result in a 2.9 percent increase in payments for all services paid under the OPPS in CY 2023, after considering all of the changes to APC reconfiguration and recalibration, as well as the OPD fee schedule increase factor, wage index changes, including the frontier State wage index adjustment, estimated payment for outliers, changes to the pass-through payment estimate, proposed exception for rural SCHs from the clinic visit policy for services furnished at off campus PBDs, and proposed adjustment for the additional resource costs of acquiring domestic NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators. However, some classes of providers that are paid under the OPPS would experience more significant gains or losses in OPPS payments in CY 2023.  Executive Order 13132 establishes certain requirements that an agency must meet when it promulgates a proposed rule (and subsequent final rule) that imposes substantial direct costs on State and local governments, preempts State law, or otherwise has federalism implications. We have examined the OPPS and ASC provisions included in this proposed rule in accordance with Executive Order 13132, Federalism, and have determined that they will not have a substantial direct effect on State, local or tribal governments, preempt State law, or otherwise have a federalism implication. As reflected in Table 84 of this proposed rule, we estimate that OPPS payments to governmental hospitals (including State and local governmental hospitals) would increase by 2.8 percent under this proposed rule. While we do not know the number of ASCs or CMHCs with government ownership, we anticipate that it is small. The analyses we have provided in this section of this proposed rule, in conjunction with the remainder of this document, demonstrate that this proposed rule is consistent with the regulatory philosophy and principles identified in Executive Order 12866, the RFA, and section 1102(b) of the Act. This proposed rule would affect payments to a substantial number of small rural hospitals and a small number of rural ASCs, as well as other classes of hospitals, CMHCs, and ASCs, and some effects may be significant. However, as noted in section XXV, this proposed rule should not have a significant effect on small rural hospitals.

OPPS Payment for Software as a Service'): \"Rapid advances in innovative technology are having a profound effect on every facet of health care delivery. Novel and evolving technologies are introducing advances in treatment options that have the potential to increase access to care for Medicare beneficiaries, improve outcomes, and reduce overall costs to the program. In some cases, these innovative technologies are substituting for more invasive care and/or augmenting the practice of medicine.  Starting in 2018, we began making payment for the SaaS procedure Fractional Flow Reserve Derived from Computed Tomography (FFRCT), also known by the trade name HeartFlow. HeartFlow is a noninvasive diagnostic service that allows physicians to measure coronary artery disease in a patient through the use of coronary CT scans. The HeartFlow SaaS procedure is intended for clinically stable symptomatic patients with coronary artery disease, and, in many cases, its use may eliminate the need for an invasive coronary angiogram procedure. HeartFlow uses a proprietary data analysis process performed at a central facility to develop a three-dimensional image of a patient's coronary arteries, which allows physicians to identify the fractional flow reserve to assess whether patients should undergo further invasive testing (that is, a coronary angiogram). i.e., While HeartFlow was the first SaaS procedure for which we made separate payment under the OPPS, we have since begun paying for other SaaS procedures. In CY 2021, we assigned CPT code 92229 (Imaging of retina for detection or monitoring of disease; point-of-care automated analysis and report, unilateral or bilateral), an artificial intelligence system to detect diabetic retinopathy known as IDx-DR to APC 5733 with the status indicator “S” (85 FR 85960 thorugh 85961). IDx-DR uses an artificial intelligence algorithm to review images of a patient's retina to provide a clinical decision as to whether the patient needs to be referred to an eyecare professional for diabetic retinopathy or rescreened in twelve months (negative for mild diabetic retinopathy). Also in CY 2021, we began paying for CPT code 0615T (Eye-movement analysis without spatial calibration, with interpretation and report), which involves the use of the EyeBOX system as an aid in the diagnosis of concussion. We assigned EyeBOX to APC 5734 with the status indicator “Q1,” to indicate that the code is conditionally packaged when performed with another service on the same day (85 FR 85952 through 85953). Over the past several years, the AMA has established several codes that describe SaaS procedures. HeartFlow, IDx-DR, and the EyeBox System are each described by single CPT codes. But for a procedure known by the tradename LiverMultiScan, the CPT editorial panel created two CPT codes for CY 2022, a primary code and an add-on code: 0648T:e.g.,e.g., 0649T:e.g.,e.g., LiverMultiScan uses clinical software to aid the diagnosis and management of chronic liver disease through analysis using proprietary algorithms of MR images acquired from patients' providers. As described above, the coding for LiverMultiScan is bifurcated into CPT code 0648T, billable when LiverMultiScan is used to analyze already existing images, and CPT add-on code 0649T, describing the LiverMultiScan software analysis, which is adjunctive to the acquisition of the MR images. In accordance with our OPPS policy, we review all new CPT codes and, for those that are payable under the OPPS, we assign them to appropriate APCs and make status indicator assignments for them. In the CY 2022 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period, we assigned CPT code 0648T to New Technology APC 1511 (86 FR 63542). Given the dependent nature and adjunctive characteristics of procedures described by add-on codes and in light of our longstanding OPPS packaging principles, payment for add-on codes is generally packaged into the primary procedure. In the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (78 FR 74942 through 74945) and in the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (79 FR 66817 through 66818), we stated that procedures described by add-on codes represent an extension or continuation of a primary procedure, which means they are ancillary, supportive, dependent, or adjunctive to a primary service. Add-on codes describe services that are always performed in addition to a primary procedure and are never reported as a stand-alone code. Because the second LiverMultiScan code—CPT code 0649T—is an add-on code, in accordance with our current OPPS policy, we packaged payment for it with the primary service with which it is furnished, rather than paying for it separately as we do for the primary LiverMultiScan code—CPT code 0648T (86 FR 63541 through 63543).\", ('SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:', 'X.

Addition of a New Service Category for Hospital Outpatient Department (OPD) Prior Authorization Process', 'B. Controlling Unnecessary Increases in the Volume of Covered OPD Services'): \"In accordance with §\\u2009419.83(b), we proposed to require prior authorization for a new service category: Facet Joint Interventions. We proposed adding the new service category at §\\u2009419.83(a)(3). We also proposed that the prior authorization process for this additional service category would be effective for dates of services on or after March 1, 2023. As explained more fully below, the proposed addition of this service category is consistent with our authority under section 1833(t)(2)(F) of the Act and is based upon our determination that there has been an unnecessary increase in the volume of these services. Because we proposed that prior authorization would be required for this service category at a later date than for the first seven service categories, we proposed to revise paragraph (a)(3) to include this new service category and reflect the March 1, 2023 implementation date for the prior authorization requirement for this additional service category. Specifically, we proposed that paragraph (a)(3) would read, “[t]he Facet Joint Interventions service category requires prior authorization beginning for service dates on or after March 1, 2023.” We also proposed that existing paragraph (a)(3) be moved to paragraph (b), and that paragraph (b) be revised by modifying the heading to read, “Adoption of the list of services and technical updates.” We also proposed to re-designate the current paragraph (b) as paragraph (b)(1). We proposed that paragraph (b)(1) would provide that CMS will adopt the list of hospital outpatient department service categories requiring prior authorization and any updates or geographic restrictions through formal notice-and-comment rulemaking. We proposed that current paragraph (a)(3) would be moved to new paragraph (b)(2) and provide that technical updates to the list of services, such as changes to the name of the service or CPT code, will be published on the CMS website. We proposed that the Facet joint interventions service category would consist of facet joint injections, medial branch blocks, and facet joint nerve destruction. Facet joint injections are procedures in which a practitioner injects medication into the facet joints (the connections between the bones of the spine) to help diagnose the cause and location of pain and also to provide pain relief. Medial branch block is a procedure in which a medication is injected near the medial branch nerve connected to a specific facet joint to achieve pain relief. Facet joint nerve destruction (also known as nerve denervation) is a procedure that uses heat to destroy the small area of the facet joint nerve for pain management. We proposed that the list of proposed additional OPD services in the Facet joint interventions service category that would require prior authorization beginning on March 1, 2023, are those identified by the CPT codes in Table 103. For ease of review and brevity, we only included in the regulation text in proposed new §\\u2009419.83(a)(3) the name of the service category, but not the CPT codes that fall into that service category, which are listed in Table 103. Note that this is the same approach we took in establishing the initial five service categories in §\\u2009419.83(a)(1) and two additional service categories in §\\u2009419.83(a)(2). Again, we proposed that the prior authorization process for the proposed additional service category would be effective for dates of service on or after March 1, 2023. We proposed an effective date slightly earlier in the calendar year (compared to July 1, 2020, and July 1, 2021, effective dates for the service categories previously added to the prior authorization regulation) because Medicare Contractors, CMS, and the OPD providers already have knowledge of and experience with the prior authorization process. Also, this new service category can be performed by some of the same provider types who furnish other services currently subject to the OPD prior authorization process, such as implanted spinal neurostimulators and cervical fusion with disc removal. As part of our responsibility to protect the Medicare Trust Funds, we noted in the proposed rule that we continue our routine analysis of data associated with all aspects of the Medicare program. This responsibility includes monitoring the total amount or types of claims submitted by providers and suppliers; analyzing the claims data to assess the growth in the number of claims submitted over time (for example, monthly and annually, among other intervals); and conducting comparisons of the data with other relevant data, such as the total number of Medicare beneficiaries served by providers, to help ensure the continued appropriateness of payment for services furnished in the hospital OPD setting.   https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Computer-Data-and-Systems/IDR/index.html As noted in the proposed rule, when analyzing the data, we took the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (PHE) into consideration. As a result of the PHE, healthcare use and spending dropped sharply due to cancellations of elective and non-emergency care to increase hospital capacity and social distancing measures to reduce the community spread of the coronavirus. Consequently, the claims data for CY 2020 showed a significant decrease in volume compared to the previous year, which is likely due to the PHE. However, over the 9-year period of our analysis, services for Facet joint interventions demonstrated increases. These volume increases led us to further research the reasons behind them to determine if they were unnecessary.  https://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region9/92003003.asp https://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region9/92103002.asp https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/16-defendants-including-12-physicians-sentenced-prison-distributing-66-million-opioid-pills In the proposed rule, we said that our conclusion that increases in volume for facet joint services are unnecessary was based not only on the data specific to this service category but also on a comparison of the rate of increase for the service category to the overall trends for all OPD services. We noted our belief that comparing the utilization rate for the particular service category to the overall rate of growth for Medicare OPD services generally is an appropriate method for identifying unnecessary increases in volume, particularly where there are no legitimate clinical or coding reasons for the changes. We researched possible causes for the increases in volume that would indicate the services are increasingly necessary, but we did not find any explanations that would cause us to believe that was the case. In the proposed rule, we reaffirmed our belief that prior authorization is an effective mechanism to ensure Medicare beneficiaries receive medically necessary care while protecting the Medicare Trust Funds from unnecessary increases in volume by virtue of improper payments without adding onerous new documentation requirements. A broad program integrity strategy must use a variety of tools to best account for potential fraud, waste, and abuse, including unnecessary increases in volume. We believe prior authorization for these services will be an effective method for controlling unnecessary increases in the volume of these services and expect that it will reduce the instances in which Medicare pays for services that are determined not to be medically necessary. We solicited comments on the addition of this service category and specifically requested comments on the potential for any unintended clinical consequences from the addition of this service category. We received 69 comments on this proposal, including comments from healthcare providers, professional and trade organizations, and device manufacturers. The following is a summary of the comments we received and our responses. Comment: Response: Comment: Response: Additionally, we note that our prior authorization policy does not create any new documentation requirements. Instead, it requires hospitals to submit the same documents needed to support claim payments, just earlier in the process. Therefore, HOPDs should not need to divert resources from patient care. We note that prior authorization has the added benefit of giving hospitals some assurance of payment for services for which they received a provisional affirmation. In addition, beneficiaries have information regarding coverage prior to receiving the service and benefit from knowing in advance of receiving the service if they will incur financial liability because the service is non-covered. CMS will continue tracking MAC timeliness metrics and is confident that the MACs will continue to meet the required review and decision timeframes to avoid causing an additional burden for HOPDs or delaying medically necessary services. Comment: Response: Although we believe CMS and MACs have sufficient resources to manage additional prior authorization requests, we acknowledge the commenters' concerns about the proposed March 1, 2023, implementation date for the new service category. While we explained in the proposed rule that the effective date for the new service category would be March 1, 2023, because MACs, CMS, and HOPDs already have knowledge of and experience with the prior authorization process, we recognize that all participants would benefit from additional time to prepare for the addition of Facet joint interventions service category to the prior authorization processes. Accordingly, we are finalizing an implementation date for prior authorization for the Facet joint interventions service category of July 1, 2023, which is consistent with previous July 1 implementation dates for current service categories. Comment: Response: https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/pmtf-final-report-2019-05-23.pdf. Commenters are correct that many services in other categories for which we require prior authorization are cosmetic, while services in the Facet joint intervention service category are not. We also acknowledge the benefits that Facet joint intervention services offer for chronic pain. However, we reiterate that these are non-emergency procedures that require the beneficiary to undergo at least 3 months of conservative treatment prior to the procedure. For that reason, these procedures generally are elective.

A broad program integrity strategy must use a variety of tools to best account for potential fraud, waste, and abuse, including unnecessary increases in volume. We believe prior authorization for these services will be an effective method for controlling unnecessary increases in the volume of these services and expect that it will reduce the instances in which Medicare pays for services that are determined not to be medically necessary. After consideration of the public comments we received, we are finalizing our proposal to add the Facet joint interventions service category to the list of hospital outpatient department services requiring prior authorization with modification. In particular, we are finalizing an implementation date for prior authorization for the Facet joint interventions service category of July 1, 2023, rather than the March 1, 2023 implementation date we proposed and making this change in the proposed regulation text at §\\u2009419.83(a)(3). Other than this change in the implementation date, we are finalizing the proposed regulation text changes as proposed.    https://www.medicare.gov/care-compare334\\u2009335\\u2009336\\u2009337\\u2009338\\u2009339\\u2009340 CMS.govhttps://www.cms.gov//newsroom//fact-sheets//first-release-overall-hospital-quality-star-rating-hospital-compare.    qualitynet.org: https://qualitynet.org/inpatient/public-reporting/overall-ratings/resources#tab2 qualitynet.org: https://qualitynet.org/inpatient/public-reporting/overall-ratings/resources#tab2 www.qualitynet.orghttps://qualitynet.org/outpatient/public-reporting/overall-ratings/resources qualitynet.org: https://qualitynet.org/inpatient/public-reporting/overall-ratings/resources#tab2 In the CY 2023 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (87 FR 44807-44809), we: (1) provided information on the previously finalized policy for inclusion of quality measure data from Veterans Health Administration (VHA) hospitals; (2) proposed to amend the language of §\\u2009412.190(c) to state that we would use publicly available measure results on Hospital Compare or its successor websites from a quarter within the prior twelve months; and (3) conveyed that although CMS intends to publish Overall Hospital Quality Star Ratings in 2023, we may apply the suppression policy if applicable. In the CY 2021 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (85 FR 86197 and 86198), we finalized a policy to include Veterans Health Administration hospitals' (VHA hospitals) quality measure data for the purpose of calculating the Overall Hospital Quality Star Ratings beginning with the 2023 refresh. In that final rule, we also stated that we intended to provide more information about the statistical impact of adding VHA hospitals to the Overall Star Rating and discuss procedural aspects in a future rule (85 FR 48999). Since the publication of the CY 2021 OPPS/ASC final rule, we conducted an internal analysis from February 28, 2022, through March 30, 2022, with measure data from all VHA hospitals in the calculation of the Overall Hospital Quality Star Ratings methodology. The internal analysis included a period of confidential reporting and feedback during which VHA hospitals reviewed their Overall Hospital Quality Star Ratings internal analysis results, and in addition, further familiarized themselves with the Overall Hospital Quality Star Ratings methodology and had the opportunity to ask questions. All VHA hospitals were made aware of the internal analysis and were provided the opportunity to participate. For the internal analysis, the Overall Hospital Quality Star Ratings were calculated using VHA hospital measure data along with subsection (d) hospitals and CAHs. The internal analysis included the same measures used for the April 2021 refresh of Overall Hospital Quality Star Ratings on our public reporting website, Care Compare. At the time of the 2022 VHA internal analysis, VHA hospitals in each peer group reported a similar number of measures when compared to non-VHA hospitals for most measure groups. VHA hospitals in the five-measure group peer group reported a lower median number of Safety and Readmission measures. VHA hospitals in all three peer groups reported fewer measures in the Timely and Effective Care measure group. The measurement periods for VHA and non-VHA hospitals were the same, except for the HAI-1, HAI-2, PSI 04, PSI 90, and OP-22 measures. The specific performance periods for these measures were provided to VHA hospitals during the internal analysis. The reasons for the differing measure reporting periods are: • The HAI-1 and HAI-2 measures were first publicly reported for VHA hospitals in July 2021, but only included one quarter of measure data. Therefore, we chose to use the next public reporting, April 2022, which included four quarters of these measures' data.  • For the OP-22 measure, VHA hospitals began submitting their measure data in January 2021 for public reporting. • For the HIP/KNEE measures (total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA)), we used measure data that were publicly reported in October 2020. These data did not initially include VHA hospitals, so we recalculated to include them. The recalculated results including VHA hospitals was not publicly reported until July 2021. Using these data from the internal analysis, we compared 2021 Overall Hospital Quality Star Ratings scores for non-VHA hospitals before and after adding VHA hospitals to Overall Hospital Quality Star Ratings. 119 out of 171 VHA hospitals met the requirements to receive a Star Rating. This increased the number of hospitals receiving a star rating from 3,355 to 3,474. The distribution of Star Ratings was nearly identical for VHA and non-VHA hospitals. As part of the Overall Hospital Quality Star Ratings methodology, hospitals are assigned to peer groups based on the number of measure groups with at least three measures. Peer group assignments were similar across VHA and non-VHA hospitals. In Peer Group 3, assignments were 12 percent VHA vs. 10 percent non-VHA; in Peer Group 4, assignments were 25 percent VHA vs. 16 percent non-VHA; and in Peer Group 5, assignments were 63 percent VHA vs. 74 percent non-VHA). 3,119 (93 percent) non-VHA hospitals maintained the same number of stars after adding VHA hospitals to 2021 Overall Hospital Quality Star Ratings. For the 236 non-VHA hospitals with a different star rating, 23 gained a star and 213 lost a star. No hospital gained or lost more than one star. As with any update to either the underlying measures or the Overall Hospital Quality Star Ratings methodology, we expect that some hospitals would shift star rating categories. However, for this internal analysis, over 90 percent of non-VHA hospitals did not experience a change in their Overall Hospital Quality Star Ratings score, which is consistent with prior changes to the measures or methodology in our experience. As previously finalized, we intend to include VHA hospitals in future Overall Hospital Quality Star Ratings. While we did not make any proposals for VA hospital data in the proposed rule, we received some comments, which we are summarizing below. Comment: Response: Comment: Response: While the results of the VHA hospital Star Rating internal analyses demonstrated that VHA hospitals report fewer measures on average, 63 percent of VHA hospitals still reported at least three measures in all five measure groups, which landed them in the five-measure group peer group (87 FR 44808). Many hospitals that report fewer measures than VHA hospitals are included in Overall Star Ratings, and we believe it is important for the public to have access to Overall Star Ratings for as many hospitals as possible, while still adhering to the Overall Star Ratings guiding principles to: • Use scientifically valid methods that are inclusive of hospitals and measure information and able to accommodate underlying measure changes; • Align with Care Compare or its successor website and CMS programs; • Provide transparency of the methods for calculating the Overall Star Rating; and • Be responsive to stakeholder input.  Comment: Response: Comment: Response: Comment: Response: While we did not make any proposals for VHA hospital data in the proposed rule, we appreciate related stakeholder feedback that we received. In the CY 2023 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (87 FR 44807), we proposed to amend our policy regarding the data periods used to refresh Overall Hospital Quality Star Ratings. In the CY 2021 OPPS final rule with comment period, we stated that “we would use publicly available measure results on Hospital Compare or its successor websites from a quarter within the prior year” to refresh Overall Hospital Quality Star Ratings (85 FR 86202). As discussed in the CY 2023 OPP/ASC proposed rule, since adopting that policy, it has come to our attention that this wording could be confusing. We intended for the phrase “within the prior year” to refer to any time within the prior 12 months, and not to a Care Compare refresh from the prior calendar year. Therefore, we proposed to change §\\u2009412.190(c) to provide that the Overall Star Rating are published once annually using data publicly reported on Hospital Compare or its successor website from a quarter within the previous 12 months. For example, for the Overall Hospital Quality Star Ratings in July 2023, we would use any Care Compare refreshes from the previous 12 months: July 2023, April 2023, January 2023, October 2022, or July 2022. We invited public comments on this proposal. Comment: Response: Comment: Response: Comment: Response: After consideration of the public comments we received, we are finalizing the proposal as proposed and thank the commenters for their input.  www.qualitynet.orghttps://qualitynet.org/inpatient/public-reporting/overall-ratings/resources#tab1 www.qualitynet.orghttps://qualitynet.org/outpatient/public-reporting/overall-ratings/resources We discussed in the CY 2023 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (87 FR 44807) that we recognize there may be some concerns with publishing Overall Hospital Quality Star Ratings if the underlying measures reflect some aspect of extenuating circumstances, for example, skewed data or performance related to treating patients with COVID-19. However, we want to balance that with providing important quality information to Medicare beneficiaries and the public during times when hospital care is critical. The goal of the Overall Hospital Quality Star Ratings is to summarize hospital quality information in a way that is simple and easy for patients to understand to increase transparency and empower patients to make more informed decisions about their healthcare. https://www.cms.gov/files/document/guidance-memo-exceptions-and-extensions-quality-reporting-and-value-based-purchasing-programs.pdf https://www.cms.gov/files/document/guidance-memo-exceptions-and-extensions-quality-reporting-and-value-based-purchasing-programs.pdf If a measure is considered valid and reliable enough to be reported on Care Compare then it meets the criteria to be included in Overall Hospital Quality Star Ratings calculations (85 FR 86193 through 86236). This remains true even for measures that were suppressed in certain pay-for-performance programs due to the impact of COVID-19 (86 FR 45301 through 45304). Consistent with this policy, we will continue to include measures in the Overall Hospital Quality Star Ratings that might have been suppressed in the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing, Hospital-Acquired Condition Reduction, and Hospital Readmissions Reduction Programs but are still publicly reported (86 FR 44778 through 44779). In the CY 2021 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (85 FR 48996 through 49027), we finalized that we will allow for suppression, but only in limited circumstances. Specifically, for the Overall Hospital Quality Star Rating beginning with the CY 2021 and for subsequent years, we adopted a policy that we would consider suppressing the Overall Star Rating only under extenuating circumstances that affect numerous hospitals (as in, not an individualized or localized issue) as determined by CMS or when CMS is at fault, including but not limited to when— There is an Overall Star Rating calculation error by CMS; There is a systemic error at the CMS quality program level that substantively affects the Overall Hospital Star Rating calculation. For example, there is a CMS quality program level error for one or more measures included within the Overall Star Rating due to incorrect data processing or measure calculations that affects a substantial number of hospitals reporting those measures. We note that we would strive to first correct systemic errors at the program level per program policies and then recalculate the Overall Star Rating, if possible; or A Public Health Emergency substantially affects the underlying measure data. This is codified at §\\u2009412.190(f)(1). Although we intend to publish the Overall Hospital Quality Star Rating in 2023, we may exercise the authority described above should the COVID-19 PHE substantially affect the underlying measure data. While we did not make any proposals in this section, we are summarizing comments received below. Comment: Response: Comment: Response: Comment: Response: Comment: Response: Comment: Response: While we did not make any proposals for the suppression of Overall Star Ratings in the proposed rule, we appreciate related stakeholder feedback that we received. Federal Register For purposes of Medicare payment, section 1861(b) of the Act defines inpatient hospital services in part as the following items and services furnished to an inpatient of a hospital and (except as provided in paragraph (3)) by the hospital: (1) bed and board; (2) such nursing services and other related services, such use of hospital facilities, and such medical social services as are ordinarily furnished by the hospital for the care and treatment of inpatients, and (3) such other diagnostic or therapeutic items or services, furnished by the hospital or by others under arrangements with them made by the hospital, as are ordinarily furnished to inpatients either by such hospital or by others under such arrangements. Routine services in the hospital setting are those described in sections 1861(b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Act, under the definition of “inpatient hospital services.” Under our historical policy for hospital services furnished under arrangements that we adopted in the FY 2012 IPPS/LTCH PPS rulemaking (76 FR 51714), routine services cannot be provided under arrangement outside the hospital. Only the therapeutic and diagnostic services described in section 1861(b)(3) of the Act can be provided under arrangement outside the hospital. In the April 6, 2020 IFC (85 FR 19278), we provided an overview of the FY 2012 IPPS/LTCH PPS rulemaking, which set forth the rationale and statutory basis for our under arrangements policy. In particular, we stated in the FY 2012 rulemaking that we believe this policy is consistent with the statute because the statutory language specifying that the routine services described in sections 1861(b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Act be provided “by the hospital” suggests that the hospital is required to exercise professional responsibility over the services, including quality controls. In situations in which certain routine services are provided through arrangement “in the hospital,” for example, contracted nursing services, we stated that we believe the arrangement generally results in the hospital exercising the same level of control over those services as the hospital does in situations in which the services are provided by the hospital's salaried employees. Therefore, if routine services are provided in the hospital to its inpatients, we consider the service as being provided by the hospital. However, if these services are provided to its patients outside the hospital, the services are considered as being provided under arrangement, and not by the hospital. Therefore, consistent with the statute, we stated that only therapeutic and diagnostic services can be provided under arrangement outside the hospital. Furthermore, we noted that, at the time of the FY 2012 rulemaking, we were aware that some hospitals were furnishing certain routine services, including ICU services, under arrangement, which we believed might result in inappropriate and potentially excessive Medicare payments for such services in certain circumstances. We explained that limiting the furnishing of routine services under arrangements to situations in which the services are furnished in the hospital would reduce the opportunity for gaming and ensure that the hospital exercises sufficient control over the use of hospital resources when furnishing these services. For additional details on our prior rulemaking, refer to the discussion in section II.CC.2 of the April 6, 2020 IFC (85 FR 19278) and the FY 2012 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (76 FR 51711). As we noted in the April 6, 2020 IFC (85 FR 19279), while we continue to believe that our historical policy is consistent with the statute and appropriate for the reasons discussed in the FY 2012 IPPS/LTCH PPS rulemaking, we wished to give hospitals that provide services to Medicare beneficiaries additional flexibilities to respond effectively to the serious public health threats posed by the spread of COVID-19. Recognizing the urgency of this situation, and understanding that some pre-existing Medicare payment rules might inhibit use of capacity that might otherwise be effective in the efforts to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on Medicare beneficiaries and the American public, we changed our “under arrangements” policy during the PHE for the COVID-19 pandemic beginning March 1, 2020, so that hospitals could be allowed broader flexibilities to furnish inpatient services, including routine services outside the hospital's campus or premises.  Moreover, we stated that we did not believe that the statute would preclude this temporary change in policy to allow routine services to be provided under arrangements outside the hospital, in light of the compelling circumstances and the need for additional, short-term flexibility during the current PHE for the COVID-19 pandemic. Consistent with this, we noted that we received comments during the FY 2012 rulemaking stating that our policy to limit the services a hospital may provide under arrangements is not required by the statute and that CMS' reading of the statutory definition of “inpatient hospital services” is only one possible interpretation of the statute. While we changed our under arrangements policy during the PHE for the COVID-19 pandemic to allow hospitals broader flexibilities in furnishing inpatient services, we emphasized in the April 6, 2020 IFC that we were not changing our policy that a hospital needs to exercise sufficient control and responsibility over the use of hospital resources in treating patients, as discussed in the FY 2012 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule and Section 10.3 of Chapter 5 of the Medicare General Information, Eligibility, and Entitlement Manual (Pub. 100-01). Nothing in the current PHE for the COVID-19 pandemic has changed our policy or thinking with respect to this issue and we made no modifications to this aspect of the policy. We emphasized that hospitals need to continue to exercise sufficient control and responsibility over the use of hospital resources in treating patients regardless of whether that treatment occurs in the hospital or outside the hospital under arrangements. If a hospital cannot exercise sufficient control and responsibility over the use of hospital resources under arrangements, the hospital should not provide those services outside the hospital under arrangements. Comment: Response: Comment: Response: After consideration of the comments received, and for the reasons discussed, we are finalizing without modification our policy that, effective for services provided for discharges for patients admitted to the hospital during the PHE for COVID-19 beginning March 1, 2020 until the end of the PHE, if routine services are provided under arrangements outside the hospital to its inpatients, these services are considered as being provided by the hospital. We are not changing our policy that a hospital needs to exercise sufficient control and responsibility over the use of hospital resources in treating patients regardless of whether that treatment occurs in the hospital or outside the hospital under arrangements. When the COVID-19 PHE ends, and consistent with the policy adopted in the FY 2012 IPPS/LTCH PPS rulemaking, for purposes of Medicare payment, only the therapeutic and diagnostic items and services described in section 1861(b)(3) of the Act may be furnished under arrangements outside the hospital. If routine services are provided in the hospital to its inpatients, these services will be considered as being provided by the hospital. However, if these services are provided to patients outside the hospital, the services will be considered as being provided under arrangement, and not by the hospital. In the April 6, 2020-IFC (85 FR 19269), we included provisions revising 42 CFR 415.172, 415.174, 415.180, 415.184, and 415.208 for the duration of the PHE that allowed a hospital to claim a resident for indirect medical education (IME) or direct graduate medical education (DGME) if the resident is performing patient care activities within the scope of his or her approved program via telecommunications, in his or her own home, or in a patient's home. This allowed medical residents to perform their duties in alternate locations, including their own home or a patient's home, as long as the activities meet appropriate physician supervision requirements, which could also be met via telecommunications participation. In this section of this final rule, we are responding to the public comments that we received on these provisions in the April 6, 2020 IFC and finalizing the interim policies. Comment: Response:  In this final rule with comment period, we are finalizing the provisions of the April 6, 2020 IFC without modification, to allow a hospital to claim a resident for IME or DGME if the resident is performing patient care activities within the scope of his or her approved program in his or her own home, or in a patient's home for the duration of the COVID-19 PHE. We note, when the COVID-19 PHE ends, a hospital may not count a resident for purposes of Medicare DGME payments or IME payments if the resident is performing activities with the scope of his/her approved program in his/her own home, or a patient's home. This policy does not require any changes to the regulations text. Under 42 CFR 412.622(a)(3)(iv), for an inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF) claim to be considered reasonable and necessary under section 1862(a)(1) of the Act, there must be a reasonable expectation at the time of the patient's admission to the IRF that the patient requires physician supervision by a rehabilitation physician, defined as a licensed physician with specialized training and experience in inpatient rehabilitation. The requirement for medical supervision means that the rehabilitation physician must conduct face-to-face visits with the patient at least 3 days per week throughout the patient's stay in the IRF to assess the patient both medically and functionally, as well as modify the course of treatment as needed to maximize the patient's capacity to benefit from the rehabilitation process. The purpose of the physician supervision requirement is to ensure that the patient's medical and functional statuses are being continuously monitored as the patient's overall plan of care is being carried out. We note that, in the FY 2021 IRF PPS final rule (85 FR 48450 through 48453), we amended the IRF coverage requirements to allow, beginning with the second week of admission to the IRF, a nonphysician practitioner who is determined by the IRF to have specialized training and experience in inpatient rehabilitation to conduct 1 of the 3 required face-to-face visits with the patient per week, provided that such duties are within the non-physician practitioner's scope of practice under applicable state law. We continue to believe that it is in the patient's best interest to be seen in person by a rehabilitation physician (or, in accordance with the revised regulations, a nonphysician practitioner) to assess their medical and functional statuses while at the IRF, and we encourage rehabilitation physicians (or, in accordance with the revised regulations, nonphysician practitioners) to continue to visit IRF patients in person as long as all necessary precautions, including the use of PPE, are taken to ensure the health and safety of the patient and the physician. However, in the April 6, 2020 IFC (85 FR 19252), we stated that we would temporarily allow the face-to-face visit requirements at §§\\u2009412.622(a)(3)(iv) and 412.29(e) to be conducted via telehealth to safeguard the health and safety of Medicare beneficiaries and the rehabilitation physicians (or, in accordance with the revised regulations, the nonphysician practitioners) treating them during the PHE for the COVID-19 pandemic. This provision allowed rehabilitation physicians (or, in accordance with the revised regulations, nonphysician practitioners) to use telehealth services, as defined in section 1834(m)(4)(F) of the Act, to conduct the required 3 physician visits per week during the PHE for the COVID-19 pandemic. By increasing access to telehealth, we believe that this provision has provided the necessary flexibility for Medicare beneficiaries to be able to receive medically necessary services without jeopardizing their health or the health of those who are providing those services, while minimizing the overall risk to public health. We received several comments on the flexibility allowing rehabilitation physicians (or, in accordance with the revised regulations, nonphysician practitioners) to use telehealth services as defined in section 1834(m)(4)(F) of the Act to conduct the required 3 physician visits per week during the COVID-19 PHE, which are addressed below. Comment: Response: Comment: Response:  In the April 6, 2020 IFC (85 FR 19245 through 19246) we altered, for the duration of the PHE, the definition of direct supervision at §§\\u2009410.32(b)(3)(ii) and 410.28(e), to state that the necessary presence of the physician includes virtual presence through audio/video real-time communications technology when use of such technology was indicated to reduce exposure risks for the beneficiary or health care provider. We similarly altered the definition of direct supervision of pulmonary, cardiac and intensive rehabilitation at §\\u2009410.27(a)(1)(iv)(D), to state that the necessary presence of the physician includes virtual presence through audio/video real-time communications technology when use of such technology is indicated to reduce exposure risks for the beneficiary or health care provider. In the CY 2021 PFS final rule (85 FR 84538 through 84540), we revised §\\u2009410.32(b)(3)(ii) to extend the duration of the altered definition of direct supervision until the later of December 31st, 2021, or the end of the calendar year in which the PHE ends. In the CY 2021 OPPS final rule (85 FR 86110 through 86113), we revised §\\u2009410.27(a)(1)(iv)(D) to extend the duration of the altered definition of direct supervision of pulmonary, cardiac and intensive rehabilitation until the later of December 31st, 2021 or the end of the calendar year in which the PHE ends. In the CY 2023 OPPS proposed rule (87 FR 44834 through 44835), we proposed to revise §\\u2009410.28(e) to extend the duration of the altered definition of direct supervision from the end of the PHE to the end of the calendar year in which the PHE ends for consistency with §§\\u2009410.32(b)(3)(ii) and 410.27(a)(1)(iv)(D). In section X.E of this final rule with comment period, we are finalizing the revisions to §\\u2009410.28(e) as proposed. In the CY 2023 OPPS proposed rule (87 FR 44679 through 87 FR 44680), we solicited comment as to whether we should extend the duration of the altered definition of direct supervision of pulmonary, cardiac and intensive rehabilitation through the end of CY 2023. Based on the comments we received in response to our solicitation, in section X.C of this final rule with comment period, we are finalizing revisions to §\\u2009410.27(a)(1)(iv)(D) to extend the duration of the altered definition of direct supervision of pulmonary, cardiac and intensive rehabilitation until the later of December 31st, 2023, or the end of the calendar year in which the PHE ends. We refer readers to the April 6, 2020 IFC (85 FR 19245 through 19246), CY 2021 PFS final rule (85 FR 84538 through 84540), CY 2021 OPPS final rule (85 FR 86110 through 86113) and the above referenced sections of this CY 2023 OPPS final rule for a more detailed discussion of the reasoning behind our revisions to §§\\u2009410.32(b)(3)(ii), 410.28(e), and 410.27(a)(1)(iv)(D). Comment: Response: https://aspr.hhs.gov/legal/PHE/Pages/covid19-13Oct2022.aspx Federal Register In the May 8, 2020 IFC (85 FR 27567 through 27568), we implemented several policies on an interim final basis related to holding hospitals harmless from reductions in IME payments due to increases in bed counts during the COVID-19 PHE. As discussed later in this section of this CY 2023 OPPS/ASC final rule, we also implemented a policy to hold IRFs and IPFs harmless from reductions to teaching status adjustment payments due to COVID-19. We refer readers to the May 8, 2020 IFC, for an overview of IME (85 FR 27567). We received public comments on the policies that we adopted on an interim basis in the IFC provisions related to the holding hospitals harmless from reductions in IME payments due to increases in bed counts due to COVID-19 (85 FR 27567 through 27568). The following is a summary of the comments we received and our responses. Comment: Response: In this final rule with comment period, we are finalizing the provisions of the May 8, 2020 IFC without modification, allowing a hospital to maintain the same available bed count as it was on the day before the COVID-19 PHE was declared, for the duration of the COVID-19 PHE. When the COVID-19 PHE ends, any added beds will be considered in determining the hospital's IME payments. As we discussed in the May 8, 2020 IFC (85 FR 27567 through 27568), we were asked by IRFs and IPFs if CMS can hold facilities harmless from a reduction in teaching status adjustment payments resulting from the temporary increase in facilities' ADC due to the influx of COVID-19 patients. We were concerned that, if a teaching IRF or IPF accepts patients from the inpatient acute care hospital to alleviate bed capacity during the PHE for the COVID-19 pandemic, the IRF's or IPF's ADC would increase, which would artificially decrease the IRF's or IPF's ratio of number of interns and residents to ADC and thereby decrease the facility's teaching status adjustment. To ensure that teaching IRFs or teaching IPFs could alleviate bed capacity issues by taking patients from the inpatient acute care hospitals without being penalized by lower teaching status adjustments, we established an interim final policy to freeze the IRFs' or IPFs' teaching status adjustment payments at their values prior to the COVID-19 PHE. Therefore, we stated that for the duration of the COVID-19 PHE, an IRF's or an IPF's teaching status adjustment payment amount would be the same as it was on the day before the COVID-19 PHE was declared. Comment: Response: In response to the request that we implement the policy in a manner that achieves the intent without potentially subjecting IRFs and IPFs to unintended consequences, we note that our intent was to hold IRFs and IPFs harmless and not to limit their teaching adjustments to the level prior to the PHE. IPF and IRF teaching status adjustments are made on a claim basis as an interim payment, and the final payment in full for the claim is made during the final settlement of the cost report. In accordance with this hold harmless policy, we intend to clarify in the cost reporting instructions that for cost reporting periods ending on or after March 1, 2020 and beginning before the end of the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency, if an IRF's or IPF's calculated teaching adjustment factor is below the teaching adjustment factor that was applicable on February 29, 2020, then the IRF's or IPF's teaching adjustment factor is equal to the teaching adjustment factor that was applicable on February 29, 2020. Lastly, regarding the suggestion that we allow IPFs and IRFs that send residents to work in another hospital to claim such resident FTE time spent at another hospital, we note that we did not include this as part of our interim final policy for IRF and IPF teaching adjustments, and we are not finalizing such a policy in this final rule with comment period. After consideration of the public comments we received, we are confirming as final this interim final policy to hold IRF and IPF teaching status adjustments harmless for the duration of the COVID-19 PHE. Therefore, we are finalizing that for the duration of the COVID-19 PHE, an IRF's or an IPF's teaching status adjustment payment amount will not be less than it was on the day before the COVID-19 PHE was declared. In the May 8, 2020 IFC (85 FR 27568 through 27569), we implemented several policies on an interim final basis related to time spent by residents at another hospital during the COVID-19 PHE. We refer readers to the May 8, 2020 IFC, for an overview of GME (85 FR 27568). We received public comments on policies that we adopted on an interim basis in the IFC provisions related to time spent by residents at another hospital during the COVID-19 PHE (85 FR 27568 through 27569). The following is a summary of the comments we received and our responses. Comment: Response: Comment: Response: Comment: Response: In this final rule with comment period, we are finalizing the provisions of the May 8, 2020 IFC without modification, allowing teaching hospitals during the COVID-19 PHE to claim for purposes of IME and DGME payments the time spent by residents training at other hospitals during the COVID-19 PHE. It is important to note that when the COVID-19 PHE ends, the presence of residents in non-teaching hospitals will trigger establishment of IME and/or DGME FTE resident caps at those non-teaching hospitals (and for DGME will trigger establishment of per resident amounts (PRAs) at those non-teaching hospitals). As a condition of payment for IRF services, §\\u2009412.622(a)(3)(ii) generally requires that a beneficiary requires and can be reasonably expected to actively participate in, and benefit from, an intensive rehabilitation therapy program on admission to the IRF. Under current industry standards, this intensive rehabilitation therapy program generally consists of at least 3 hours of therapy (physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology, or prosthetics/orthotics therapy) per day at least 5 days per week. In certain well-documented cases, this intensive rehabilitation therapy program might instead consist of at least 15 hours of intensive rehabilitation therapy within a 7-consecutive day period, beginning with the date of admission to the IRF. Benefit from this intensive rehabilitation therapy program is demonstrated by measurable improvement that will be of practical value to the patient in improving the patient's functional capacity or adaptation to impairments. The required therapy treatments must begin within 36 hours from midnight of the day of admission to the IRF. On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was enacted. Section 3711(a) of the CARES Act requires the Secretary to waive §\\u2009412.622(a)(3)(ii) during the emergency period described in section 1135(g)(1)(B) of the Act (the COVID-19 PHE). This waiver was issued on April 15, 2020. The waiver required by section 3711(a) of the CARES Act was not limited to particular IRFs or patients, and therefore, is available during the emergency period described in section 1135(g)(1)(B) of the Act regardless of whether a patient was admitted for standard IRF care or to relieve acute care hospital capacity. In the May 8, 2020 IFC (85 FR 27572), we therefore waived §\\u2009412.622(a)(3)(ii) for all patients during the COVID-19 PHE to reflect the waiver required by section 3711(a) of the CARES Act. We received several comments on the CARES Act waiver of the “3-hour rule,” which are addressed below. Comment: Response: Comment: Response:1/2  IRF care is only considered by Medicare to be reasonable and necessary under section 1862(a)(1) of the Act if the patient meets all of the IRF coverage requirements outlined in §\\u2009412.622(a)(3), (4), and (5). These requirements include requiring 2 or more types of therapy, being sufficiently stable to tolerate an intensive rehabilitation therapy program typically provided in IRFs, needing close medical supervision by a rehabilitation physician, and requiring an interdisciplinary approach to care. Failure to meet the IRF coverage criteria in a particular case results in denial of the IRF claim. We note that the April 6, 2020 IFC removed the requirement at §\\u2009412.622(a)(4)(ii) to complete a postadmission physician evaluation during the COVID-19 PHE, as defined in §\\u2009400.200. In follow up to this temporary removal of the waiver, the FY 2021 IRF PPS final rule (85 FR 48445 through 48446) removed this requirement permanently, effective for all IRF discharges beginning on or after October 1, 2020. While we generally believe that all IRFs should have to comply with the requirements at §§\\u2009412.29(d), (e), (h), and (i) and 412.622(a)(3), (4), and (5), we recognize that there are certain institutional differences between freestanding IRF hospitals and IRF distinct part units of hospitals that may impose barriers on freestanding IRF hospitals seeking to admit patients to relieve acute care hospital capacity during the COVID-19 PHE. Specifically, freestanding IRF hospitals do not have the same close affiliations with acute care hospitals that IRF distinct part units of hospitals have, and are not as able to establish billing procedures under the IPPS that IRF distinct part units have established, by virtue of the fact that the distinct part units have access to (or at least affiliations with) their parent hospitals' billing departments. Therefore, in the May 8, 2020 IFC, we amended the requirements at §§\\u2009412.29(d), (e), (h), and (i) and 412.622(a)(3), (4), and (5) to add an exception for care furnished to patients admitted to freestanding IRF hospitals (identified as those facilities with the last 4 digits of their Medicare provider numbers between 3025 through 3099) solely to relieve acute care hospital capacity during the COVID-19 PHE. We believe that freestanding IRF hospitals have needed the flexibility during the COVID-19 PHE to determine the best care for each patient who is admitted solely to relieve acute care hospital capacity. For the purposes of exercising these IRF flexibilities that are intended to provide broad flexibility for freestanding IRF hospitals to provide surge capacity in support of acute care hospitals in their state or community, CMS considers surge to be alleviated with regard to exercising these flexibilities when the state (or region, as applicable) in which the freestanding IRF is located has moved beyond phase 1 of reopening. Thus, these flexibilities are no longer available to the freestanding IRF hospital when the state is in phase 2 or phase 3 of reopening. In the Guidelines for Opening Up America Again, Phase 1 of reopening is defined specifically as a state (or region, as applicable) that satisfies all of the following, as determined by applicable state and local officials: • All vulnerable individuals continue to shelter in place. • Individuals continue social distancing. • Individuals avoid socializing in groups of more than 10. • Non-essential travel is minimized. • Visits to senior living facilities and hospitals are prohibited. • Schools and organized youth activities remain closed. These flexibilities apply to specific patients who must be discharged from the acute care hospitals to the freestanding IRFs to provide surge capacity for the acute care hospitals, and therefore apply only when those specific patients are admitted to the freestanding IRF hospitals and continue for the duration of that patient's care. We believe this allows for continuity of care and care planning consistency at admission and throughout a patient's stay if the same flexibilities apply for the duration of a patient's IRF stay. These limitations only apply to the provisions stated in the IFC and not to any blanket waivers issued, which have their own conditions. Freestanding IRF hospitals must document the particular phase for the state when admitting the patient and electing to exercise these flexibilities. For billing purposes, we have required freestanding IRF hospitals to append the “DS” modifier to the end of the IRF's unique patient identifier number (used to identify the patient's medical record in the IRF) to identify patients who are being treated in a freestanding IRF hospital solely to alleviate inpatient bed capacity in a state that is experiencing a surge during the PHE for the COVID-19 pandemic. The modifier has also been used to identify those patients for whom the requirements in §\\u2009412.622(a)(3)(i), (iii), and (iv) and (a)(4) and (5) do not apply. Freestanding IRF hospitals are paid at the IRF PPS rates for patients with the “DS” modifier. We have expected freestanding IRF hospitals to take advantage of these flexibilities for those beneficiaries who are surge patients from inpatient hospitals, while continuing to provide standard IRF-level care for those beneficiaries who would benefit from IRF-level care and would otherwise receive such care in the absence of the COVID-19 PHE. This has provided crucial flexibility to allow freestanding IRF hospitals to aid in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic in several ways. First, some of the patients that freestanding IRF hospitals have cared for during the COVID-19 PHE in states experiencing a surge would need high-acuity clinical care but may not need or be able to tolerate the intensive rehabilitation therapy typically provided in an IRF, such as at least two types of therapy. Second, waiving the documentation requirements in §\\u2009412.622(a)(4) and (5) for patients alleviating inpatient hospital bed capacity has allowed freestanding IRF hospitals to concentrate on providing care for surge patients from the acute care hospitals in a state that is experiencing a surge, instead of completing documentation that may not be applicable to these acute patients during the PHE. Third, this flexibility has allowed freestanding IRF hospitals to maximize their available beds to take advantage of space where COVID-19 patients or surge patients could be safely managed. We believe this policy has allowed freestanding IRF hospitals to make a clinical determination about what level of care each individual patient needs during the PHE for the COVID-19 pandemic. We received several comments on the modification of IRF coverage and classification requirements for freestanding IRF hospitals for the PHE during the COVID-19 pandemic, which are addressed below. Comment: Response: Comment: Response:https://www.cms.gov/coronavirus-waivers Comment: Response: Comment: Response: After carefully considering the comments we received, and for the reasons discussed, we are finalizing without modification the waiver of the requirements at §§\\u2009412.29(d), (e), (h), and (i) and 412.622(a)(3), (4), and (5) during the COVID-19 PHE for freestanding IRF hospitals admitting patients in support of acute care hospitals when the state (or region, as applicable) is in phase 1 or prior to entering phase 1 of reopening described in the May 8, 2020 IFC. Patients who are admitted to IRFs during the PHE will remain under these waivers until they are discharged from the IRFs. However, these waivers will no longer apply to patients who are admitted to IRFs after the end of COVID-19 PHE. To effectuate these changes, we are finalizing without modification the revisions to §§\\u2009412.29(d), (e), (h), and (i) and 412.622(a)(3), (4), and (5) described in the May 8, 2020 IFC. Specifically, in §\\u2009412.622(a)(3)(i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) we are finalizing language providing that these IRF coverage criteria continue to be required, except for care furnished to patients in a freestanding IRF hospital solely to relieve acute care hospital capacity in a state (or region, as applicable) that is experiencing a surge during the PHE, as defined in §\\u2009400.200. Similarly, in §\\u2009412.622(a)(4), we are finalizing this paragraph to state that the IRF documentation requirements must be present in the IRF medical record, except for care furnished to patients in a freestanding IRF hospital solely to relieve acute care hospital capacity in a state (or region, as applicable) that is experiencing a surge during the PHE, as defined in §\\u2009400.200. In §\\u2009412.622(a)(5), we are finalizing this paragraph to state that an interdisciplinary team approach to care is required, except for care furnished to patients in a freestanding IRF hospital solely to relieve acute care hospital capacity in a state (or region, as applicable) that is experiencing a surge during the PHE, as defined in §\\u2009400.200. We are also finalizing the revisions to §\\u2009412.29(d), (e), (h), and (i) to align the provisions we have waived in §\\u2009412.622 with the classification criteria for payment to freestanding IRF hospitals under the IRF prospective payment system. Finally, we are finalizing the revisions to §\\u2009412.622(c) to add a definition of state (or region, as applicable) that are experiencing a surge and §\\u2009412.29 to cross-reference that definition where applicable. A PHP is an intensive outpatient program of psychiatric services provided as an alternative to inpatient psychiatric care for individuals who have an acute mental illness, which includes, but is not limited to, conditions such as depression and schizophrenia. Section 1861(ff)(1) of the Act defines partial hospitalization services as the items and services described in paragraph (2) prescribed by a physician and provided under a program described in paragraph (3) under the supervision of a physician pursuant to an individualized, written plan of treatment established and periodically reviewed by a physician (in consultation with appropriate staff participating in such program), which sets forth the physician's diagnosis, the type, amount, frequency, and duration of the items and services provided under the plan, and the goals for treatment under the plan. Section 1861(ff)(2) of the Act describes the items and services included in partial hospitalization services. Section 1861(ff)(3)(A) of the Act specifies that a PHP is a program furnished by a hospital to its outpatients or by a CMHC, as a distinct and organized intensive ambulatory treatment service, offering less than 24-hour-daily care, in a location other than an individual's home or inpatient or residential setting. Section 1861(ff)(3)(B) of the Act defines a CMHC for purposes of this benefit. In the May 8, 2020 IFC (85 FR 27563 through 27566), we stated that infection control was a primary goal of CMS initiatives undertaken during the COVID-19 PHE. We also stated that we believe continuity of behavioral health services is critical for those participating in a PHP, particularly at a time of heightened anxiety and uncertainty. As we noted in the May 8, 2020 interim final rule (85 FR 27562), we issued numerous blanket waivers under section 1135 of the Act, including for hospitals and CMHCs providing PHP services, to give health care providers needed flexibility to address the COVID-19 PHE and support the goal of infection control while maintaining access to partial hospitalization services and ensuring continuity of care for patients. Effective as of March 1, 2020, and for the duration of the COVID-19 PHE, we established an interim final policy that a temporary expansion location where the beneficiary may be located, including a beneficiary's home, may be a provider-based department (PBD) of the hospital, or may be a temporary extension of the CMHC (discussed in more detail below).  https://www.cms.gov/coronavirus-waivers We further explained that although these services can be furnished remotely, all other PHP requirements were unchanged and still in effect, including that all services furnished under the PHP still required an order by a physician, had to be supervised and certified by a physician, and had to be furnished in accordance with coding requirements by a clinical staff member working within his or her scope of practice. We stated that in accordance with the longstanding requirements that are detailed in the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Pub 100-02, chapter 6, section 70.3, documentation in the medical record of the reason for the visit and the substance of the visit would continue to be required. We further explained that when these services are provided by clinical staff of the physician or other practitioner and furnished incident to their professional services, and are not provided by staff of the hospital or CMHC, the hospital or CMHC would not bill for the services. The physician or other practitioner would bill for such services incident to their own services and would be paid under the PFS. As detailed in the May 8, 2020 IFC (85 FR 27564), as part of the initiative to promote infection control and maintain access to PHP services, we waived the requirements for being a PBD of the hospital in §\\u2009413.65, as well as certain requirements under the Medicare conditions of participation in §§\\u2009482.41 and 485.623, to facilitate the availability of temporary expansion locations. As we noted in that IFC, for purposes of the COVID-19 PHE and effective as of March 1, 2020, a temporary expansion location where the beneficiary may be located, including a beneficiary's home, may be a PBD of the hospital where the location meets the non-waived conditions of participation. We stated that together, these waivers allow hospitals to consider a temporary expansion location where the beneficiary may be located, including their homes, an HOPD only in the context of the COVID-19 PHE. Thus, we explained that for the duration of the COVID-19 PHE, we would consider the PHP services furnished by hospital clinical staff, when the beneficiary was registered as an outpatient of the hospital and in accordance with the supervising practitioner's scope of practice, to have been furnished in the hospital to the beneficiary in a temporary expansion location, including a beneficiary's home, so long as such temporary expansion location was made provider-based to the hospital. We noted that the hospital was instructed to bill for these services as if they were furnished in the hospital and consistent with any specific requirements for billing Medicare during the COVID-19 PHE. A CMHC is a provider of PHP services defined under section 1861(ff)(3)(B) of the Act. As we discussed in the May 8, 2020 IFC (85 FR 27564), for the duration of the COVID-19 PHE, we waived the restriction at §\\u2009485.918(b)(1)(iii) for the purpose of providing PHP services to CMHC patients in their homes, which we stated would be considered a temporary expansion location of a CMHC. Certain therapeutic services by CMHC staff would be paid when provided for beneficiaries registered as outpatients, in accordance with the supervising practitioner's scope of practice, consistent with any specific requirements for billing Medicare during the COVID-19 PHE. Comment:  Response: Regarding the concern about clerical staff lacking the qualifications to provide the services described, we note that we explained in the May 8, 2020 IFC that, although these services can be furnished remotely, all other PHP requirements are unchanged and still in effect, including that all services furnished under the PHP still require an order by a physician, must be supervised by a physician, must be certified by a physician, and must be furnished in accordance with coding requirements by a clinical staff member working within his or her scope of practice (85 FR 27564). Lastly, regarding the commenter's suggestion of a transition policy, as we explained in the May 8, 2020 IFC, this interim final policy depends on numerous blanket waivers under section 1135 of the Act, and will apply for the duration of the COVID-19 PHE. After those blanket waivers expire at the end of the COVID-19 PHE, section 1861(ff)(3)(A) of the Act limits Medicare's ability to pay for partial hospitalization services furnished to beneficiaries in a home or residential setting. After consideration of the public comments we received, we are confirming as final this interim final policy. Therefore, for the duration of the COVID-19 PHE only, providers can furnish certain partial hospitalization services remotely to patients in a temporary expansion location of the hospital or CMHC, which may include the patient's home to the extent it is made provider-based to the hospital or an extension of the CMHC. As we explained in the May 8, 2020 IFC (85 FR 27562 through 27566), outpatient education and training services require communication and interaction between the patient and the clinical staff providing the service. We stated that facility staff can effectively furnish these services using telecommunications technology and, unlike many hospital services, the clinical staff and patient are not required to be in the same location to furnish them. We further explained that blanket waivers in effect during the COVID-19 PHE allow temporary expansion locations, including beneficiaries' homes, to become provider-based departments (PBDs) of the hospital during the COVID-19 PHE and therapeutic outpatient hospital services furnished to beneficiaries in these provider-based locations can meet the requirement that these services be furnished in the hospital so long as all other requirements are met, including the hospital conditions of participation, to the extent not waived, during the COVID-19 PHE. . In light of the need for infection control and a desire for continuity of care, we recognized the ability of the hospital's clinical staff to continue to deliver these services even when the beneficiary is not physically located in the hospital. Therefore, in the May 8, 2020 IFC (85 FR 27564), we made clear that when a hospital's clinical staff are furnishing hospital outpatient services (such as drug administration, education, and training services) to a patient in the hospital (which can include the patient's home so long as it is provider-based to the hospital), and the patient is registered as an outpatient of the hospital, we will consider the requirements of the regulations at §\\u2009410.27(a)(1) to be met. We referred to this policy as Hospitals without Walls (HWW). Further, we clarified that when a patient is receiving a professional service via telehealth in a location that is considered a hospital PBD, and the patient is a registered outpatient of the hospital, the hospital in which the patient is registered may bill the originating site facility fee for the service. Finally, we also clarified the applicability of section 603 of the BBA 2015 to hospitals furnishing care in the beneficiaries' homes (or other temporary expansion locations), and whether those locations are considered relocated, partially relocated, or new PBDs. We reminded readers that the physician supervision level for the vast majority of hospital outpatient therapeutic services is currently general supervision under §\\u2009410.27. This means a service must be furnished under the physician's overall direction and control, but the physician's presence is not required during the performance of the service. In section X.A.1 of this final rule with comment period we are finalizing the IFC policy with respect to mental health services furnished remotely to beneficiaries in their homes, through an alternate regulatory authority that does not rely upon the HWW framework. Comment: Response: Comment: Response:  In the May 8, 2020 IFC (85 FR 27567 through 27568), we implemented a policy on an interim final basis related to treatment of new and certain relocating provider-based departments (PBDs) during the PHE. We refer readers to the May 8, 2020 IFC for an overview of that policy (85 FR 27567). Comment: Response: Comment: Response: Comment: Response:  Federal Register Under the OPPS Comprehensive APC (C-APC) policy, when a service that we have designated as a primary C-APC service is reported on a hospital outpatient claim, with certain exceptions, we make payment for all other items and services reported on the claim as being integral, ancillary, supportive, dependent, and adjunctive to the primary service and representing components of a complete comprehensive service. This results in a single prospective payment for each of the primary comprehensive services based on the costs of all reported services at the claim level. Under our current policy, payment for drugs or biological products with emergency authorization or approved to treat COVID-19 in the outpatient setting would be packaged into the payment for a primary service when billed on the claim for that service. In the November 9, 2020 IFC, we stated that although many beneficiaries would likely not receive both a primary C-APC service and a drug or biological for treating COVID-19, we nonetheless believed that, as drugs or biologicals became available and were authorized or approved for the treatment of COVID-19 in the outpatient setting, it would be appropriate to mitigate any potential financial disincentives for hospitals to provide these new treatments during the PHE for COVID-19. Accordingly, effective for services furnished on or after the effective date of the November 9, 2020 IFC and until the end of the PHE for COVID-19, we created an exception to our OPPS C-APC policy to ensure new COVID-19 treatments that meet two criteria would, for the remainder of the PHE for COVID-19, always be separately paid and not packaged into a C-APC when they appear on the same claim as the primary C-APC service. The first criterion is that the treatment must be a drug or biological product (which could include a blood product) authorized to treat COVID-19, as indicated in section “I. Criteria for Issuance of Authorization” of the letter of authorization for the drug or biological product, or the drug or biological product must be approved by the FDA for treating COVID-19. The second criterion is that the EUA for the drug or biological product (which could include a blood product) must authorize the use of the product in the outpatient setting or not limit its use to the inpatient setting, or the product must be approved by the FDA to treat COVID-19 disease and not limit its use to the inpatient setting. We refer readers to the November 6, 2020 IFC for a full overview of this policy (85 FR 71158 through 71160). Comment: Response: Comment: Response: Given the public comments we received, we are finalizing this policy as implemented in the November 6, 2020 IFC. Accordingly, this policy will end with the end of the PHE.  In addition, for CY 2023, we proposed to update the column titled “Drug Pass-Through Expiration during Calendar Year” to include devices, so that the column reads: “Drug and Device Pass-Through Expiration during Calendar Year” where we proposed to flag, through the use of an asterisk, each drug and device for which pass-through payment would be expiring during the calendar year on a date other than December 31. For CY 2023, we did not receive any public comments and, therefore, are finalizing our proposal to update the column to include devices, so that the column reads: “Drug and Device Pass-Through Expiration during Calendar Year” where we would flag, through the use of an asterisk, each drug and device for which pass-through payment would be expiring during the calendar year on a date other than December 31. https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/HospitalOutpatientPPS/Hospital-Outpatient-Regulations-and-Notices.htmlhttps://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/ASCPayment/ASC-Regulations-and-Notices.html Federal Register • The need for the information collection and its usefulness in carrying out the proper functions of our agency. • The accuracy of our estimate of the information collection burden. • The quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected. • Recommendations to minimize the information collection burden on the affected public, including automated collection techniques. We solicited public comment on each of these issues for the following sections of this document that contain information collection requirements (ICRs): The Hospital Outpatient Quality Reporting (OQR) Program is generally aligned with the CMS quality reporting program for hospital inpatient services known as the Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting (IQR) Program. We refer readers to the CY 2011 through CY 2022 OPPS/ASC final rules (75 FR 72111 through 72114; 76 FR 74549 through 74554; 77 FR 68527 through 68532; 78 FR 75170 through 75172; 79 FR 67012 through 67015; 80 FR 70580 through 70582; 81 FR 79862 through 79863; 82 FR 59476 through 59479; 83 FR 59155 through 59156; 84 FR 61468 through 61469; 85 FR 86266 through 86267; and 86 FR 63961 through 63968, respectively) for detailed discussions of the previously finalized Hospital OQR Program ICRs. The ICRs associated with the Hospital OQR Program are currently approved under OMB control number 0938-1109, which expires on February 28, 2025. In the CY 2022 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period, our burden estimates were based on an assumption of 3,300 hospitals (86 FR 63961). For the CY 2023 OPPS/ASC final rule, we have updated our assumption to 3,350 hospitals based on recent data from the CY 2022 payment determination which reflects a closer approximation of the total number of hospitals reporting data for the Hospital OQR Program.  https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes292072.htm  In the CY 2022 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (86 FR 63845 through 63846), we finalized to require this measure with mandatory reporting beginning with the CY 2025 reporting period/CY 2027 payment determination. We previously finalized voluntary reporting of this measure in the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (79 FR 66947 through 66948) and estimated that 20 percent of hospitals would elect to report it annually (79 FR 67014). As discussed in section XIV.B.5.b of this final rule with comment period, we are finalizing to change this measure to voluntary beginning with the CY 2025 reporting period/CY 2027 payment determination. We continue to estimate it will require hospitals 10 minutes once annually to report this measure using a CMS web-based tool. As a result, we estimate only 20 percent of hospitals will voluntarily submit data, which results in a total annual burden estimate of 112 hours (3,350 hospitals × 20 percent × 0.1667 hours) at a cost of $5,188 (112 hours × $46.46/hour). In addition to reporting the measure, for hospitals that chose to voluntarily submit, we also require hospitals to perform chart abstraction and estimate that each hospital will spend 2.92 minutes (0.049 hours) per case per measure to perform this activity. In the CY 2022 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period, we used an estimate of 25 minutes per case per measure (86 FR 63963). Upon review, this estimate was erroneous, therefore we are correcting our assumption to 2.92 minutes (0.049 hours) per case per measure as finalized in the CY 2016 OPPS/ASC final rule (80 FR 70582). The currently approved burden estimate assumes 242 cases per measure. For chart abstraction, we estimate an annual burden of 12 hours (0.049 hours × 242 cases) at a cost of $549 (12 hours × $46.46/hour) per hospital and a total annual burden of 7,891 hours (3,350 hospitals × 20 percent × 12 hours) at a cost of $368,028 (7,891 hours × $46.46/hour) for all participating hospitals. In aggregate, we estimate a total annual burden of 8,003 hours (112 hours + 7,891 hours) at a cost of $373,216 ($5,188 + $368,028) for all hospitals. This is a decrease of 325,847 hours and $15,138,852 per year from the currently approved estimate due to the 80 percent of hospitals we assume will no longer report this measure, the updated assumption of the number of hospitals participating in the Hospital OQR Program, the updated burden estimate for chart abstraction, and the updated wage rate. The information collection requirement and the associated burden will be submitted as part of a revision of the information collection request currently approved under OMB control number 0938-1109, which expires on February 28, 2025. In section XIV.B.4 of this final rule with comment period, we are finalizing to adopt an additional targeting criterion to the validation selection policy beginning with the CY 2023 reporting period/CY 2025 payment determination. We also are finalizing to codify this targeting criterion at §\\u2009419.46(f)(3). We do not believe this policy will increase reporting burden, because it changes neither the total number of hospitals required to submit data nor the amount of data hospitals selected for validation would be required to submit. In section XIV.B.4.b of this final rule with comment period, we are finalizing to align patient encounter quarters with the calendar year (January through December), beginning with the CY 2026 payment determination and subsequent years. This finalized period will not result in any increase in information collection burden because it will not change the amount of data hospitals will be required to submit. In summary, under OMB control number 0938-1109 which expires on February 28, 2025 we estimate that the updated assumptions and policies promulgated in this final rule with comment period will result in a decrease of 325,847 hours annually for 3,350 OPPS hospitals for the CY 2025 reporting period/CY 2027 payment determination and subsequent years. The total cost decrease related to this information collection is approximately -$15,138,852 (325,847 hours × $46.46/hour) (which also reflects use of an updated hourly wage rate as previously discussed). Table 104 summarizes the estimated total burden change compared to our currently approved information collection burden estimates. We will submit the revised information collection estimates to OMB for approval under OMB control number 0938-1109. We did not finalize any changes for the CY 2024 reporting period/CY 2026 payment determination, therefore the previously finalized burden estimates for the CY 2024 reporting period/CY 2026 payment determination remain unchanged. We refer readers to the CY 2012 OPPS/ASC final rule (76 FR 74554), the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (77 FR 53672), and the CY 2013, CY 2014, CY 2015, CY 2016, CY 2017, CY 2018, CY 2019, CY 2020, CY 2021, and CY 2022 OPPS/ASC final rules (77 FR 68532 through 68533; 78 FR 75172 through 75174; 79 FR 67015 through 67016; 80 FR 70582 through 70584; 81 FR 79863 through 79865; 82 FR 59479 through 59481; 83 FR 59156 through 59157; 84 FR 61469; 85 FR 86267; and 86 FR 63968 through 63971, respectively) for detailed discussions of the Ambulatory Surgical Center Quality Reporting (ASCQR) Program ICRs we have previously finalized. The ICRs associated with the ASCQR Program for the CY 2014 through CY 2023 payment determinations are currently approved under OMB control number 0938-1270, which expires on July 31, 2024.  https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes292072.htm  In section XV.B.4 of this final rule with comment period, we are finalizing to change the Cataracts: Improvement in Patient's Visual Function within 90 days Following Cataract Surgery measure (ASC-11) to voluntary beginning with the CY 2025 reporting period/CY 2027 payment determination. In the CY 2022 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (86 FR 63886 through 63887), we finalized to require this measure with mandatory reporting beginning with the CY 2025 reporting period/CY 2027 payment determination. We previously finalized voluntary reporting of this measure in the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (79 FR 66985) and estimated that 20 percent of ASCs would elect to report it annually (79 FR 67016). As discussed in section XV.B.5.b of this final rule with comment period, we are finalizing to change the ASC-11 measure to voluntary beginning with the CY 2025 reporting period/CY 2027 payment determination. We continue to estimate it will require ASCs 10 minutes once annually to report this measure using a CMS web-based tool. As a result of our finalized policy, we estimate only 20 percent of ASCs will voluntarily submit data, which results in a total annual burden estimate for all participating ASCs of 155 hours (4,646 ASCs × 20 percent × 0.1667 hours) at a cost of $7,194 (115 hours × $46.46/hour). In addition to reporting the measure, for ASCs that chose to voluntarily submit, we also require ASCs to perform chart abstraction for a minimum required sample size of 63 cases. In the CY 2022 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period, we estimated that each ASC would spend 15 minutes (0.25 hours) per case to perform this activity (86 FR 63969). However, upon review, we believe the effort involved with this activity is similar to what is required for the OP-31 measure in the Hospital OQR Program, therefore, we are updating our assumption to 2.92 minutes (0.049 hours) per case per measure. Therefore, we estimate an annual burden of 3.1 hours (0.049 hours × 63 cases) at a cost of $142 (3.1 hours × $46.46/hour) per ASC and a total annual burden of 2,848 hours (4,646 ASCs × 20 percent × 3.1 hours) at a cost of $132,333 (2,848 hours × $46.46/hour) for all participating ASCs. In aggregate, we estimate a total annual burden of 3,003 hours (155 hours + 2,848 hours) at a cost of $139,527 ($7,194 + $132,333) for all ASCs. This is a decrease of 72,107 hours and $3,350,091 per year from the currently approved estimate due to the 80 percent of ASCs we assume will no longer report this measure, the updated burden estimate per case per measure, and the updated wage rate. In summary, under OMB control number 0938-1270 which expires on July 31, 2024, we estimate that the policies promulgated in this final rule with comment period will result in a decrease of 72,107 hours annually for 4,646 ASCs for the CY 2025 reporting period/CY 2027 payment determination and subsequent years. The total cost decrease related to this information collection is approximately $3,350,091 (72,107 hours × $46.46/hour). Table 105 summarizes the total burden change compared to our currently approved information collection burden estimates. We will submit the revised information collection estimates to OMB for approval under OMB control number 0938-1270. As discussed in section XVIII.E of this final rule with comment period, we are finalizing our proposal to revise certain existing exceptions applicable to compensation arrangements involving specific types of providers to make them applicable to compensation arrangements to which an REH is a party. Specifically, we are finalizing our proposal to revise the exceptions for physician recruitment at §\\u2009411.357(e), obstetrical malpractice insurance subsidies at §\\u2009411.357(r), retention payments in underserved areas at §\\u2009411.357(t), electronic prescribing items and services at §\\u2009411.357(v), assistance to compensate a nonphysician practitioner at §\\u2009411.357(x), and timeshare arrangements at §\\u2009411.357(y) to also permit an REH to provide remuneration to a physician (or an immediate family member of a physician) if all requirements of the applicable exception are satisfied. All of the finalized proposals will ensure that exceptions that may already be utilized by existing hospitals eligible to undergo conversion to an REH remain available to REHs. The existing exceptions at §\\u2009411.357(e), (r), (t), (v), (x), and (y) each require that the compensation arrangements to which the exceptions apply be documented in a writing signed by the parties. The existing exception at §\\u2009411.357(t)(2) also requires a written certification that the physician has a bona fide opportunity for future employment by a hospital, academic medical center, or physician organization that requires the physician to move the location of his or her medical practice at least 25 miles and outside the geographic area served by the hospital. The existing exception at §\\u2009411.357(x) also requires that records of the actual amount of remuneration provided by the hospital to the physician, and by the physician to the nonphysician practitioner, must be maintained for a period of at least 6 years. We did not propose, and are not finalizing, any changes to the existing writing, signature, or record retention requirements. The burden associated with writing and signature requirements will be the time and effort necessary to prepare written documents and obtain signatures of the parties. The burden associated with record retention requirements is the time and effort necessary to compile and store the records. As noted in the CY 2023 OPPS/ASC proposed rule, while the writing, signature, and record retention requirements are subject to the PRA, we believe the associated burden is exempt under 5 CFR 1320.3(b)(2). We believe that the time, effort, and financial resources necessary to comply with these requirements would be incurred by persons without Federal regulation during the normal course of their activities. Specifically, we believe that, for normal business operations purposes, health care providers and suppliers document their financial arrangements with physicians and others and retain these documents in order to identify and be able to enforce the legal obligations of the parties. Therefore, we believe that the writing, signature, and record retention requirements should be considered usual and customary business practices. We did not receive any public comments regarding our position that the burden associated with these requirements is a usual and customary business practice that is exempt from the PRA.   In accordance with §\\u2009419.83(b), we are finalizing our proposal to require prior authorization for a new service category: Facet joint interventions. We are adding the service category to §\\u2009419.83(a)(3). We also are finalizing that the prior authorization process for the additional service category will be effective for dates of services on or after July 1, 2023. The ICR associated with prior authorization requests for these covered outpatient department services is the required documentation submitted by providers. The prior authorization request must include all relevant documentation necessary to show that the service meets applicable Medicare coverage, coding, and payment rules and the request must be submitted before the service is provided to the beneficiary and before the claim is submitted for processing. The burden associated with the prior authorization process for the new category, Facet joint interventions, will be the time and effort necessary for the submitter to locate and obtain the relevant supporting documentation to show that the service meets applicable coverage, coding, and payment rules, and to forward the information to CMS or its contractor (MAC) for review and determination of a provisional affirmation. We expect that this information will generally be maintained by providers within the normal course of business and that this information will be readily available. We estimate that the average time for office clerical activities associated with this task will be 30 minutes, which is equivalent to that for normal prepayment or post payment medical review. We anticipate that most prior authorization requests will be sent by means other than mail. However, we estimate a cost of $5 per request for mailing medical records. Due to July 1, 2023 start date, the first year of the prior authorization for the new service category will only include 6 months. Based on CY 2019 data, we estimate that for those first 6 months there will be 41,701initial requests mailed during the year. In addition, we estimate there will be 13,683 resubmissions of a request mailed following a non-affirmed decision. Therefore, the total mailing cost is estimated to be $276,920 (55,384 mailed requests × $5). Based on CY 2019 data for the new service category, we estimate that annually there will be 83,401 initial requests mailed during a year. In addition, we estimate there will be 27,366 resubmissions of a request mailed following a non-affirmed decision. Therefore, the total annual mailing cost is estimated to be $553,838 (110,786 mailed requests × $5). We also estimate that an additional 3 hours per provider will be required for attending educational meetings, training staff on what services require prior authorization, and reviewing training documents.  Table 106 below is a chart reflecting the total burden and associated costs for the provisions included in this final rule with comment period. In section X.H of this final rule with comment period, we are finalizing IPPS and OPPS payment adjustments for the additional resource costs of domestic NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators for cost reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023. The payment adjustments will be based on the IPPS and OPPS shares of the estimated difference in the reasonable costs of a hospital to purchase domestic NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators compared to non-domestic ones. As discussed in section X.H of this final rule with comment period, in order to calculate the N95 payment adjustment for each eligible cost reporting period, we created a new cost report worksheet to collect additional information from hospitals. Specifically, the new cost report worksheet will collect the following: (1) total quantity of domestic NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators purchased by hospital; (2) total aggregate cost of domestic NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators purchased by hospital; (3) total quantity of non-domestic NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators purchased by hospital; and (4) total aggregate cost of non-domestic NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators purchased by hospital. This new information will be used along with other information already collected on the Hospitals and Health Care Complex Cost Report (Form CMS-2552-10) approved under OMB control number 0938-0050 to calculate an IPPS payment adjustment amount and an OPPS payment adjustment amount. This new cost report worksheet may be submitted by a provider of service as part of the annual filing of the cost report and make available to its contractor and CMS, documentation to substantiate the data included on this Medicare cost report worksheet. The documentation requirements are based on the recordkeeping requirements at current §\\u2009413.20, which require providers of services to maintain sufficient financial records and statistical data for proper determination of costs payable under Medicare.   Federal Register https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes433031.htm www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes132011.htm Federal Register https://www.shepscenter.unc.edu/product/how-many-hospitals-might-convert-to-a-rural-emergency-hospital-reh/ https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm#43-0000 The burden associated with this requirement will be included as part of a resubmission of the information collection previously approved under 0938-0685. In addition to the announcement in this rule, we will also be publishing the required 60-day and 30-day notices to formally announce the aforementioned resubmission request and to both inform the public on where to find the revised PRA package for review and where to submit comments.  https://www.shepscenter.unc.edu/product/how-many-hospitals-might-convert-to-a-rural-emergency-hospital-reh/  https://www.claconnect.com/resources/articles/2022/a-path-forward-clas-simulations-on-rural-emergency-hospital-designation In total, the NC RHRP study estimated that there are 1,673 hospitals (mostly CAHs) eligible to convert to an REH and of these, 68 would convert to REH status. The reasons why some would convert are presented in the NC RHRP study and include low levels of inpatient revenue, low levels of swing bed nursing care revenue, and negative financial margins over a period of years. The finances of individual rural hospitals and CAHs vary widely, as do the local economic and demographic circumstances of the communities served by these facilities (for example some rural areas are gaining population even as most face declining populations). Competition from other hospitals either in the rural area or in nearby cities also varies widely, with the only certainty in forecasting REH conversion is that seemingly similar hospitals and CAHs will make widely different decisions. What the NC RHRP did, in essence, was predict that the hospitals and CAHs facing the most severe financial difficulties would be the most likely to convert. For purposes of our analysis, we use the NC RHRP estimate of 68 conversions though acknowledge that the number of conversions could be less than or significantly greater than this estimate. In addition, when considering the PRA burden for REHs, given that the CoPs align closely with existing standards, we considered both the existing burden estimates for CAHs and hospitals, as well as our ongoing experience with these provider types. We also considered that REHs would only be furnishing outpatient services, which would lessen their burden.  May 2020 National Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates Unitedhttps://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm Section 485.514(a) would require REHs to furnish health care services in accordance with appropriate written policies that are consistent with applicable state law. In addition, §\\u2009485.514(b) would require REHs to develop the policies with the advice of members of the REH's professional health care staff, while §\\u2009485.514(d) would require REHs to conduct a biennial review of all its policies and procedures. We have not designated any specific process or format for REHs to use in developing their policies or conducting a review of their policies because we believe they need the flexibility to determine how best to accomplish these tasks.  Consistent with the recent changes we made to the hospital and CAH infection control CoPs related to COVID-19 and the declared public health emergency (PHE), we proposed to require REHs, after the conclusion of the current COVID-19 PHE, to report COVID-19 and seasonal influenza-related reporting. The requirements would apply upon conclusion of the COVID-19 PHE and would continue until April 30, 2024, unless the Secretary establishes an earlier ending date. The data elements align closely with those COVID-19 reporting requirements for long-term care (LTC) facilities that were finalized on November 9, 2021 (86 FR 62421) and are representative of the guidance provided to hospitals and CAHs for reporting. Therefore, we do not expect that these categories of data elements would require REHs to report any information beyond that which they have already been reporting as existing rural hospitals or CAHs. Furthermore, similar to the requirements for LTC facilities, this requirement would also allow for the scope and frequency of data collection to be reduced and limited responsive to the evolving clinical and epidemiological circumstances. https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/covid-19-faqs-hospitals-hospital-laboratory-acute-care-facility-data-reporting.pdf If we were to assume a weekly reporting frequency, we would anticipate that there are reduced cases and fewer data elements (with no line level patient data) being reported. Based on these assumptions, we estimate that total annual burden hours for REHs to comply with these requirements would be 5,304 hours based on weekly reporting of the required information by 68 REHs × 52 weeks per year and at an average weekly response time of 1.5 hours for a registered nurse with an average hourly salary of $79. Therefore, the estimate for total annual costs for all hospitals and CAHs to comply with the required reporting provisions weekly would be $419,016 or approximately $6,162 per facility annually. We acknowledge that the data elements and reporting frequency could increase or decrease over the next two years, and those changes would impact this burden estimate. We note that this estimate is assumed to be a one-day snapshot of reporting information as opposed to a cumulative weekly report accounting for information based on each day of that week. If we assumed a cumulative weekly account, we can assume reduced burden related to the actual reporting time, but anticipate that the estimate would be slightly higher to account for the need to track closely to daily reporting. We also acknowledge that respondents may have to track and invest in infrastructure in order to timely and accurately report on the specified frequency. Thus, respondents may face ongoing burdens associated with this collection even in the case of reduced frequency of submissions. We solicit comment on this potentiality. Furthermore, we note that this estimate likely overestimates the costs associated with reporting because it assumes that all REHs will report manually. Efforts are underway to automate reporting that have the potential to significantly decrease reporting burden and improve reliability. In addition, we proposed to establish reporting requirements for future PHEs related to epidemics and pandemics by requiring REHs to electronically report information on Acute Respiratory Illness (including, but not limited to, Seasonal Influenza Virus, Influenza-like Illness, and Severe Acute Respiratory Infection), SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, and other viral and bacterial pathogens or infectious diseases of pandemic or epidemic potential only when the Secretary has declared a PHE directly related to such specific pathogens and infectious diseases. Specifically, when the Secretary has declared a PHE, we proposed to require REHs to report specific data elements to the CDC's National Health Safety Network (NHSN), or other CDC-supported surveillance systems, as determined by the Secretary. The final requirements of this section would apply to local, state, and national PHEs as declared by the Secretary. Relevant to the declared PHE, the categories of data elements that this report would include are as follows: suspected and confirmed infections of the relevant infectious disease pathogen among patients and staff; total deaths attributed to the relevant infectious disease pathogen among patients and staff; personal protective equipment and other relevant supplies in the facility; capacity and supplies in the facility relevant to the immediate and long term treatment of the relevant infectious disease pathogen, such as ventilator and dialysis/continuous renal replacement therapy capacity and supplies; total REH bed and intensive care unit bed census, capacity, and capability; staffing shortages; vaccine administration status of patients and staff for conditions monitored under this section and where a specific vaccine is applicable; relevant therapeutic inventories and/or usage; isolation capacity, including airborne isolation capacity; and key co-morbidities and/or exposure risk factors of patients being treated for the pathogen or disease of interest in this section that are captured with interoperable data standards and elements.  For purposes of this burden collection, we acknowledge the unknown and the ongoing burdens that may exist even if CMS is not collecting information outside of a declared PHE. We recognize that considerations such as building and maintaining the infrastructure to support readiness are necessary to ensure compliance with this requirement. Federal Register We proposed that the emergency department of the REH be staffed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and we propose this requirement at §\\u2009485.6528(a) and that a doctor of medicine or osteopathy, nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, or physician assistant must be available to furnish services in the REH in the facility 24 hours a day. The burden associated with this requirement is the time it takes to review the REH's written policies and make appropriate changes or updates regarding its staffing and staff responsibilities for the services it furnishes. In conjunction with a mid-level practitioner, the physician develops, executes, and periodically reviews the REH's written policies governing the services it furnishes. We estimate that it will take the physician and mid-level practitioner 1 hour each to review the REH written policies and make the appropriate changes. We also estimate that a REH will utilize the services of one clerical person for half an hour to process any changes or updates, for a total of 2.5 burden hours and an estimated cost per REH of $ 330 ((1 hour × $210 for a physician) + (1 hour × $101 for a mid-level practitioner) + (0.5 hours × $38 for clerical staff)). Therefore, the burden associated with this requirement is an estimated 170 burden hours (2.5 hours × 68 REHs) at an estimated cost of $22,440 ($330 × 68 REHs). Proposed §\\u2009485.534(a) would require REHs to notify a patient of their rights and of whom to contact to file a grievance. We allow REHs the flexibility to use different approaches to meet this CoP. We have set forth general elements that should be common to all grievance processes, but have not delineated strategies and policies for implementing this system. We believe that in large measure, REHs would be able to use existing systems for providing patients with information and handling complaints, and the elements listed in the regulation only serve to give basic assurance that these systems are responsive to patient grievances and act effectively. A less specific approach would permit a nominal, non-functional system that in essence did not serve the very purpose intended by the regulation. Costs associated with formalizing a process and modifying any existing notices or processes will most likely be partially offset by a reduction in patient-initiated lawsuits regarding care, and should provide a valuable tool for targeting internal quality assurance mechanisms. We asked that the patient be provided with written notice containing a contact person's name, the steps taken on behalf of the patient to investigate the grievance, the results of the grievance process, and the date of completion. Steps taken on behalf of the patient need not include a detailed description of who was spoken to and when. It might merely be that the appropriate staff were interviewed and that records were reviewed to investigate the grievance, and that the investigation found the grievance to be either unsubstantiated or substantiated. Second, the figures represented are estimates. We know of no existing system that tracks how many complaints are lodged in aggregate in hospitals or CAHs each year; however, for REHs, we believe that the grievance response can largely rely on standardized language with only relevant information filled in, or could be created in a check-sheet format, or in many other ways.  https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-05-12-00081.pdf  The burden associated with this requirement is the time and effort necessary to disclose the written notice to each patient who filed a grievance. We estimate that on average it will take each REH 15 minutes to develop and disseminate the required notice and estimate that an REH may have to provide 50 notices on an annual basis for a total annual burden. The burden hours would be 13 hours (0.25 hours × 50 notices). The total burden hours would be 884 hours (13 hours × 68 REHs) at the cost of $33,592 ($38 × 884 hours). Therefore, the total burden associated with this requirement is $188,632 ($5,168 to update notices, $149,872 to provide the notices, and $33,592 to provide the results of a grievance investigation). Section 485.534(d), which sets forth the patient's right to access information in their records, will involve minimal burden as many states' existing laws cover this point. We have not proposed to require disclosure of all records, inasmuch as we recognize that there are situations where such a release could be harmful to the patient or another individual. Furthermore, we have not taken a prescriptive approach in specifying how quickly this information must be provided to the patient, or by setting a rate that the REH can charge. In the absence of state law, the REH should charge whatever is reasonable and customary in its community for duplication services (based on rates at local commercial copy centers, post offices, or other venues in which one could make photocopies). Therefore, while this requirement is subject to the PRA, we believe that the burden associated with this requirement is exempt from the PRA, as defined in 5 CFR 1320.3(b)(2) and (3) because this requirement is considered standard industry practice and/or is required under state or local law. Section 485.534(e) requires that REH must have written policies and procedures regarding the use of restraint and seclusion that are consistent with current standards of practice. While the requirement is subject to the PRA, we believe the associated burden is exempt in accordance with 5 CFR 1320.3(b)(2) because the time, and effort, and financial resources necessary to comply with this requirement would be incurred by persons in the normal course of their activities. These are reasonable and customary state practices based on current standards of practice and the state would impose this standard for efficient utilization of Medicare or Medicaid services in the absence of a Federal requirement. However, we are soliciting comment on whether this is a customary business practice or whether this would impose an additional burden on those providers eligible to convert to an REH. Section 485.534(f) requires facilities to establish staff training requirements for the use of restraints and seclusion. The REH must provide competency-based training and education of REH personnel and staff, including medical staff, and, as applicable, personnel providing contracted services in the REH, on the use of restraint and seclusion. While these information collection requirements are subject to the PRA, we believe the burden associated with them are exempt as defined in 5 CFR 1320.3(b)(2) because the time, effort, and financial resources necessary to comply with the requirement are incurred by persons in the normal course of their activities. However, we are soliciting comment on whether this is a customary business practice or whether this would impose an additional burden on those providers eligible to convert to an REH. Section 485.534(g) requires the facility to report the death of a resident associated with restraint or seclusion to the CMS regional office. A report must include the name of the resident involved in the serious occurrence, a description of the occurrence, and the name, street address, and telephone number of the facility. We estimate it will take 5 minutes to report each death to the CMS regional office and to document that report. We estimate fewer than 10 deaths annually for all 68 facilities. Five (5) minutes × 10 deaths annually would equate to a national burden of 50 minutes per year. The hourly adjusted rate for a Medical and Health Service Manager responsible for notifying the CMS regional office of a death a documenting the report is $122/hour. Multiplying the total burden of 0.83 hours by the hourly wage yields an associated cost of about $101.67. Section 485.534(h) requires a REH to have written policies and procedures regarding the visitation rights of patients, including any clinically necessary or reasonable restriction or limitation that the REH may need to place on such rights and the reasons for the clinical restriction or limitation. Specifically, the written policies and procedures must contain the information listed in §\\u2009485.534(h)(1) through (4). Given that the statute requires a REH to have been either a CAH or rural hospital as of the date of enactment of the CAA, we expect these facilities to already have a visitation policy in accordance with the CAH and hospital CoPs at §§\\u2009485.635(f) and 482.13(h), respectively. Therefore, the ICR burden associated with this requirement would be the time and effort necessary for a REH to review and make any necessary updates given its conversion to an REH and to distribute that information to patients. We expect that an office secretary or other clerical staff would update and distribute, or post as appropriate, the information and could accomplish this task in 15 minutes for an estimated one-time burden total of 17 hours (0.25 hours × 68 REHs) and at the cost of $646 ($38 × 17 hours).  There is no burden attributed to this task. The REH's health care services are furnished in accordance with appropriate written policies that are consistent with applicable state law. The policies include a description of the services the REH furnishes directly and those furnished through agreement or arrangement; policies and procedures for emergency medical services and guidelines for medical management of health problems that include the conditions requiring medical consultation and/or patient referral and the maintenance of health care records. We are not including burden associated with certain patient related activities such as health care plans, patient records, medical records, etc., because prudent institutions already incur this burden in the course of doing everyday business. As stated in 5 CFR 1320.3(b)(2), the burden associated with usual and customary business practices is exempt from the PRA. However, we are soliciting comment on whether this is a customary business practice or whether this would impose an additional burden on those providers eligible to convert to an REH. Further, state laws require providers to maintain patient records. (For example, the annotated Code of Maryland (10.11.03.13) requires a provider to be responsible for maintaining patient records for services that it provides.) State law requires record information that should include: documentation of personal interviews; diagnosis and treatment recommendations; records of professional visits and consultations; and consultant notes which shall be appropriately initialed or signed. At §\\u2009485.536, we require REHs to develop, implement, and maintain an effective, ongoing, REH-wide, data-driven quality assessment and performance improvement (QAPI) program. The REH's governing body must ensure that the program reflects the complexity of the REH's organization and services; involves all REH departments and services (including those services furnished under contract or arrangement); and focuses on indicators related to improved health outcomes and the prevention and reduction of medical errors. The REH must maintain and demonstrate evidence of its QAPI program for review by CMS. In addition, REHs must comply with all of the requirements set forth in proposed §\\u2009485.536(a) through (e). We believe that the REH QAPI leadership (consisting of a physician, and/or administrator, mid-level practitioner, and a nurse) would need to have at least one and potentially two meetings to ensure that the current QAPI program that the provider has established is in accordance with the proposed requirements at §\\u2009485.536. The first meeting would be to discuss the current QAPI program and what, if anything, needs to be revised based on the proposed QAPI requirements at §\\u2009485.536. The second meeting, if needed, would be to discuss strategies to update the current policies, and then to discuss the process for incorporating those changes. We believe that these meetings would take approximately 2 hours each. We estimate that the physician would have a limited amount of time, approximately 1 hour to devote to the QAPI activities. Additionally, we estimate these activities would require 4 hours of an administrator's time, 4 hours of a mid-level practitioner's time, 8 hours of a nurse's time, and 2 hours of a clerical staff person's time for a total of 19 burden hours. We believe that the REH's QAPI leadership would need to meet periodically to review and discuss the changes that would need to be made to their program. We also believe that a nurse would likely spend more time developing the program with the mid-level practitioner. The physician would likely review and approve the program. The clerical staff member would probably assist with the program's development and ensure that the program was disseminated to all of the necessary parties in the REH. Based on these factors, we estimate that for each REH to comply with the requirements in this section it would require annually 19 burden hours (1 hour for a physician + 4 hours for an administrator + 4 hours for a mid-level practitioner + 8 hours for a nurse + 2 hours for a clerical staff person) at a cost of $1,810 ($210 for a physician (1 hour × $210) + $488 for an administrator (4 hours x $122) + $404 for a mid-level practitioner (4 hours × $101) + $632 for a nurse (8 hours × $79) + $76 for a clerical staff person (2 hours × $38)). Therefore, for all 68 REHs to comply with these requirements, it would require 1,292 burden hours (19 hours × 68 REHs) at a cost of approximately $123,080 ($1,810 × 68 REHs). Section 485.542 sets forth the emergency preparedness requirements for REHs. We note that these emergency preparedness standards are consistent national parameters that all Medicare and Medicaid participating providers and suppliers must meet. This includes both rural hospitals and CAHs and therefore facility that converts to an REH would have already incurred the costs to develop and implement their emergency preparedness plan. Based on this, the burden associated with these requirements would be the on-going costs to review, maintain and implement the emergency preparedness program to ensure ongoing compliance with the requirements and as such we have developed this COI section based largely on the existing COI burden for CAHs and hospitals. We proposed to require REHs to develop and maintain an emergency preparedness plan that must be reviewed and updated at least biennially. We expect that each REH facilities director ($104 per hour) would conduct a thorough risk assessment that will consider its location and geographical area; patient population, including those with special needs; and the type of services they have the ability to provide in an emergency (12 hours biennially or 6 hours annually) based on the services that they are now providing as an REH. They each would also need to review the measures needed to ensure continuity of its operation, including delegations and succession plans. We estimate that ongoing compliance with this requirement would require 6 burden hours annually (12 biennially) from the REH facilities director. Therefore, for all 68 REHs to comply with this requirement, it would require 408 burden hours (6 × 68 REHs) at a cost of approximately $42,432 (408 hours × $104).  We believe that the requirement for REHs to review and update their policies and procedures annually constitutes a usual and customary business practice and is not subject to the PRA in accordance with 5 CFR 1320.3(b)(2). However, we are soliciting comment on whether this is a customary business practice or whether this would impose an additional burden on those providers eligible to convert to an REH. REHs are required to develop and maintain an emergency preparedness communication plan that complies with both Federal and state law and must be reviewed and updated at least annually. The burden associated with this requirement would be the time and effort necessary to review, revise, and if necessary, develop a new communications plan to ensure that it complies with the requirements of this regulation. However, we believe that most REHs have some type of emergency preparedness communication plan based on their prior status as a CAH or rural hospital. It is standard practice in the health care industry to have and maintain contact information for both staff and outside sources of assistance; alternate means of communications in case there is an interruption in phone service to the facility, such as cell phones; and a method for sharing information and medical documentation with other health care providers to ensure continuity of care for their patients. If any revisions or additions are necessary to satisfy the requirements as an REH, we expect the revisions or additions would be those incurred during the course of normal business and thereby impose no additional burden. Thus, the ICRs related to the communication plan would constitute a usual and customary business practice as stated in the implementing regulations of the PRA at 5 CFR 1320.3(b)(2) and we did not include this activity in the burden analysis. We are soliciting comment on whether this is a customary business practice or whether this would impose an additional burden on those providers eligible to convert to an REH. REHs are required to develop and maintain an emergency preparedness training and testing program. The training program must include initial training in emergency preparedness policies and procedures for all new and existing staff, individuals providing services under arrangement, and volunteers, consistent with their expected roles and must be documented. The testing program must include participation in a full-scale exercise that is community-based or when a community-based exercise is not accessible, an individual, facility-based. If an actual natural or man-made emergency that requires activation of the emergency plan is experienced, then this requirement is exempt for 1 year following the onset of the actual event. In addition, the testing program must include one additional testing exercise, which may be determined by the REH. The training must be provided biennially and two testing exercises must be conducted annually. We expect that all REHs will review their current training programs in their current capacity as hospitals or CAHs, and compare them to their risk assessments and emergency preparedness plans, emergency policies and procedures, and emergency communication plans. The CAHs will need to revise and, if necessary, develop new sections or materials to ensure their training and testing programs complied with our requirements. We anticipate that ongoing compliance with this requirement will require the involvement of an administrator, the mid-level practitioner, the facilities director, and clerical staff. We expect that a mid-level practitioner will perform the initial review of the training program (4 hours), brief the administrator and the director of facilities (2 hours), and clerical staff to revise or develop new sections for the training program (1 hour), based on the group's decisions, if necessary. This will result in a cost of $894 ($404 for a mid-level practitioner (4 hours × $101) + $244 for an administrator (2 hours × $122) + $208 for a director of facilities (2 hours × $104) + $38 for a clerical staff person (1 hour × $38)) for each REH. Therefore, for all REHs to comply with this requirement it will require an estimated 476 burden hours (7 hours × 68 REHs) at a cost of $60,792 ($894 × 68 REHs). The REH must meet the applicable provisions of the 2012 edition of the Life Safety Code (LSC) of the National Fire Protection Association. If CMS finds that the state has a fire and safety code imposed by the state law that adequately protects patients, CMS may allow the state survey agency to apply the state's fire and safety code instead of the LSC if waiving the provisions of the LSC does not adversely affect the health and safety of patients. This regulation requires a REH to maintain written evidence of regular inspections and approval by state fire control agencies. We estimate that the burden associated with maintaining written evidence of state inspections and approval would be an average of 30 minutes for clerical personnel to file the documentation, for a total of 34 burden hours (0.5 hours × 68 REHs) and a cost of $1,292 (34 hours × $38). The burden will be accounted for in a new information collection request (request for a new OMB control number) submitted for OMB approval. Table 108 that follows summarizes our estimates of burden hours and costs for REHs. We emphasize that these estimates assume 68 conversions and that the number actually converting could be a fraction of this figure, or much higher, which as discussed earlier is an uncertainty addressed in both the NC RHRP and CLA study that estimated likely conversions. Our estimates of the cost per entity, however, would not be affected by the number of conversions. Section 485.614(a) proposed to require CAHs to notify the patient of their rights and of whom to contact to file a grievance. We allow REHs the flexibility to use different approaches to meet this CoP. We have set forth general elements that should be common to all grievance processes, but have not delineated strategies and policies for implementing this system. We believe that in large measure, CAHs would be able to use existing systems for providing patients with information and handling complaints, and the elements listed in the regulation only serve to give basic assurance that these systems are responsive to patient grievances and act effectively. A less specific approach would permit a nominal, non-functional system that in essence did not serve the very purpose intended by the regulation. Costs associated with formalizing a process and modifying any existing notices or processes will most likely be offset by a reduction in patient-initiated lawsuits regarding care, and should provide a valuable tool for targeting internal quality assurance mechanisms. We proposed that the patient be provided with written notice containing a contact person's name, the steps taken on behalf of the patient to investigate the grievance, the results of the grievance process, and the date of completion. Steps taken on behalf of the patient need not include a detailed description of who was spoken to and when. It might merely be that the appropriate staff were interviewed and that records were reviewed to investigate the grievance, and that the investigation found the grievance to be either unsubstantiated or substantiated. Second, the figures represented are estimates. We know of no existing system that tracks how many complaints are lodged in aggregate in CAHs each year; however, we believe that the grievance response can largely rely on standardized language with only relevant information filled in, or could be created in a check-sheet format, or in many other ways.  https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-05-12-00081.pdf In its resolution of a grievance, a CAH must provide the patient with written notice of its decision that contains the name of the CAH contact person, the steps taken on behalf of the patient to investigate the grievance, the results of the grievance process, and the date of completion. The burden associated with this requirement is the time and effort necessary to disclose the written notice to each patient who filed a grievance. We estimate that on average it will take each REH 15 minutes to develop and disseminate the required notice and estimate that a CAH may have to provide 50 notices on an annual basis. The burden hours for each CAH will be 12.5 (0.25 hour × 50 notices) for a total of 17,000 burden hours (12.5 hours × 1,360 CAHs). The total annual burden cost is $646,000 ($38 × 17,000). Therefore, the total burden hours are 98,600 (78,880 + 17,000 + 2,720) and the total cost associated with this requirement is $3,746,800 ($103,360 to update notices, $2,997,440 to provide the notices, and $646,000 to provide the results of a grievance investigation). Section 485.614(d), which sets forth the patient's right to access information in their records, will involve minimal burden as many states' existing laws cover this point. We did not propose to require disclosure of all records, inasmuch as we recognize that there are situations where such a release could be harmful to the patient or another individual. Furthermore, we have not taken a prescriptive approach in specifying how quickly this information must be provided to the patient, or by setting a rate that the CAH can charge. In the absence of state law, the REH should charge whatever is reasonable and customary in its community for duplication services (based on rates at local commercial copy centers, post offices, or other venues in which one could make photocopies). Therefore, while this requirement is subject to the PRA, we believe that the burden associated with this requirement is exempt from the PRA, as defined in 5 CFR 1320.3(b)(2) and (3) because this requirement is considered standard industry practice and/or is required under state or local law. Section 485.614(e) requires that each CAH have written policies and procedures regarding the use of restraint and seclusion that are consistent with current standards of practice. While the requirement is subject to the PRA, we believe the associated burden is exempt in accordance with 5 CFR 1320.3(b)(2) because the time, and effort, and financial resources necessary to comply with this requirement would be incurred by persons in the normal course of their activities. These are reasonable and customary state practices and the state would impose this standard for efficient utilization of Medicare and Medicaid services in the absence of a Federal requirement. However, we are soliciting comment on whether this is a customary business practice or whether this would impose an additional burden.  Section 485.614(g) requires the facility to report the death of a resident associated with seclusion or restraint to the CMS regional office. A report must include the name of the resident involved in the serious occurrence, a description of the occurrence, and the name, street address, and telephone number of the facility. We estimate it will take 5 minutes to report each death to the CMS regional office and to document that report. We estimate fewer than 10 deaths annually for all 1,360 facilities. Five (5) minutes × 10 deaths annually would equate to a national burden of 50 minutes per year. The hourly adjusted rate for a Medical and Health Service Manager responsible for notifying the CMS regional office of a death a documenting the report is $122/hour. Multiplying the total burden of 0.83 hours by the hourly wage yields an associated cost of about $101.26. The burden for the proposed CAH provisions will be accounted for under OMB control number 0938-1043. Federal RegisterDATES This final rule with comment period is necessary to make updates to the Medicare hospital OPPS rates. It is necessary to make changes to the payment policies and rates for outpatient services furnished by hospitals and CMHCs in CY 2023. We are required under section 1833(t)(3)(C)(ii) of the Act to update annually the OPPS conversion factor used to determine the payment rates for APCs. We also are required under section 1833(t)(9)(A) of the Act to review, not less often than annually, and revise the groups, the relative payment weights, and the wage and other adjustments described in section 1833(t)(2) of the Act. We must review the clinical integrity of payment groups and relative payment weights at least annually. We are revising the APC relative payment weights using claims data for services furnished on and after January 1, 2021, through and including December 31, 2021, and processed through June 30, 2022, and June 2020 HCRIS information with cost reporting periods prior to the PHE, consistent with our final policy of using data prior to the start of the PHE. This final rule with comment period also is necessary to make updates to the ASC payment rates for CY 2023, enabling CMS to make changes to payment policies and payment rates for covered surgical procedures and covered ancillary services that are performed in ASCs in CY 2023. Because ASC payment rates are based on the OPPS relative payment weights for most of the procedures performed in ASCs, the ASC payment rates are updated annually to reflect annual changes to the OPPS relative payment weights. In addition, we are required under section 1833(i)(1) of the Act to review and update the list of surgical procedures that can be performed in an ASC, not less frequently than every 2 years. In the CY 2019 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (83 FR 59075 through 59079), we finalized a policy to update the ASC payment system rates using the hospital market basket update instead of the CPI-U for CY 2019 through 2023. We believe that this policy will help stabilize the differential between OPPS payments and ASC payments, given that the CPI-U has been generally lower than the hospital market basket, and encourage the migration of services to lower cost settings as clinically appropriate. In this final rule with comment period, we received comments on the Request for Information included in the CY 2023 OPPS/ASC proposed rule on possible alternative methodologies for counting organs for transplant hospitals and organ procurement organizations to calculate Medicare's share of organ acquisition costs. We will consider those comments in developing possible future rulemaking or other guidance.  We have examined the impacts of this final rule with comment period, as required by Executive Order 12866 on Regulatory Planning and Review (September 30, 1993), Executive Order 13563 on Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review (January 18, 2011), the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (September 19, 1980, Pub. L. 96-354), section 1102(b) of the Social Security Act, section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (March 22, 1995, Pub. L. 104-4), Executive Order 13132 on Federalism (August 4, 1999), and the Congressional Review Act (5 U.S.C. 804(2)). This section of this final rule with comment period contains the impact and other economic analyses for the provisions we are finalizing for CY 2023. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 defines a “significant regulatory action” as an action that is likely to result in a rule: (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more in any 1 year, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as “economically significant”); (2) creating a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive order. Executive Order 13563 emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. A regulatory impact analysis (RIA) must be prepared for major rules with significant regulatory action/s and/or with economically significant effects ($100 million or more in any 1 year). This final rule with comment period has been designated as an economically significant rule under section 3(f)(1) of Executive Order 12866 and hence also a major rule under Subtitle E of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (also known as the Congressional Review Act). Accordingly, this final rule with comment period has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. We have prepared a regulatory impact analysis that, to the best of our ability, presents the costs and benefits of the provisions of this final rule with comment period. We solicited public comments on the regulatory impact analysis in the CY 2023 OPPS/ASC proposed rule, and we address any public comments we received in this final rule with comment period, as appropriate. We estimate that the total increase in Federal Government expenditures under the OPPS for CY 2023, compared to CY 2022, due to the changes to the OPPS in this final rule with comment period, will be approximately $2.53 billion. Taking into account our estimated changes in enrollment, utilization, and case-mix for CY 2023, we estimate that the OPPS expenditures, including beneficiary cost-sharing, for CY 2023 will be approximately $86.5 billion, which is approximately $6.5 billion higher than estimated OPPS expenditures in CY 2022. Because the provisions of the OPPS are part of a final rule with comment period that is economically significant, as measured by the threshold of an additional $100 million in expenditures in 1 year, we have prepared this regulatory impact analysis that, to the best of our ability, presents its costs and benefits. Table 110 of this final rule with comment period displays the distributional impact of the CY 2023 changes in OPPS payment to various groups of hospitals and for CMHCs. We note that under our final CY 2023 policy, drugs and biologicals that are acquired under the 340B Program will generally be paid at ASP plus 6 percent, WAC plus 6 percent, or 95 percent of AWP, as applicable. The impacts on hospital rates as a result of this final policy are reflected in the discussion of the estimated effects of this final rule with comment period. Because we are reverting to our previous policy of generally paying ASP plus 6 percent for drugs acquired under the 340B program, we are removing the increase to the OPPS conversion factor that was adopted as part of the budget neutral implementation of the 340B policy, consistent with our longstanding policy of offsetting increases or decreases in particular payments through an adjustment to the OPPS conversion factor. We estimate that the final update to the conversion factor and other budget neutrality adjustments will increase total OPPS payments by 4.8 percent in CY 2023. The changes to the APC relative payment weights, the changes to the wage indexes, the continuation of a payment adjustment for rural SCHs, including EACHs, and the payment adjustment for cancer hospitals will not increase total OPPS payments because these changes to the OPPS are budget neutral. However, these updates will change the distribution of payments within the budget neutral system. We estimate that the total change in payments between CY 2022 and CY 2023, considering all budget-neutral payment adjustments, changes in estimated total outlier payments, the application of the frontier State wage adjustment, in addition to the application of the OPD fee schedule increase factor after all adjustments required by sections 1833(t)(3)(F), 1833(t)(3)(G), and 1833(t)(17) of the Act, the exception for rural sole community hospitals from the clinic visit policy when provided at off-campus provider based departments, and the payment adjustment for the additional resource costs for domestic NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators will increase total estimated OPPS payments by 4.5 percent.  https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/HospitalOutpatientPPS/index.html We estimate the effects of the individual policy changes by estimating payments per service, while holding all other payment policies constant. We use the best data available, but do not attempt to predict behavioral responses to our policy changes in order to isolate the effects associated with specific policies or updates, but any policy that changes payment could have a behavioral response. In addition, we have not made any adjustments for future changes in variables, such as service volume, service-mix, or number of encounters. In section V.B of this final rule with comment period, we discuss our final policy to adjust the payment amount for nonpass-through, separately payable drugs acquired by certain 340B participating hospitals through the 340B Program. In this final rule with comment period for CY 2023, for hospitals paid under the OPPS, payment for separately payable drugs and biologicals that are obtained with a 340B discount will generally be ASP plus 6 percent. Additionally, we are decreasing the OPPS conversion factor by the same percentage that we increased the OPPS conversion factor in CY 2018 to implement the 340B policy in a budget neutral manner. After applying this payment methodology for drugs and biologicals purchased under the 340B Program, we currently estimate that we would apply a budget neutrality adjustment of 0.9691 to the OPPS conversion factor to remove the original CY 2018 OPPS budget neutrality adjustment for 340B acquired drugs. More information on the comments received on the 340B policy can be found in section V.B.6 of this final rule with comment period. As discussed in section X.H of this final rule with comment period, we are finalizing IPPS and OPPS payment adjustments for the additional resource costs that hospitals incur in procuring domestic NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators. The payment adjustments will commence for cost reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023. For the IPPS, we are making this payment adjustment for the additional resource costs of domestic NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators under section 1886(d)(5)(I) of the Act. To further support the strategic policy goal of sustaining a level of supply resilience for domestic NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators that is critical to protect the health and safety of personnel and patients in a public health emergency, we are not making the IPPS payment adjustment budget neutral under the IPPS. The data currently available to calculate a spending estimate for CY 2023 under the IPPS is limited. However, we believe the methodology described next to calculate this spending estimate under the IPPS for CY 2023 is reasonable based on the information available. To calculate the estimated total spending associated with this policy under the IPPS we multiplied together estimates of the following: Estimate of the total number of NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators used in the treatment of IPPS patients in CY 2023. Estimate of the difference in the average unit cost of domestic and non-domestic NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators Estimate of the percentage of NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators used in the treatment of IPPS patients in CY 2023 that are domestic. For purposes of this estimate, we believe it is reasonable to assume that on average approximately one NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirator is used for every day a beneficiary is in the hospital. The FY 2021 MedPAR claims data used for ratesetting in the FY 2023 IPPS/LTCH final rule accounted for approximately 7.3 million IPPS discharges and 38.4 million Medicare covered days. Therefore, for CY 2023, we are estimating that the total number of NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators (both domestic and non-domestic) used in the treatment of IPPS patients will be 38.4 million. Based on available data, our best estimate of the difference in the average unit costs of domestic and non-domestic NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators is $0.20. It is particularly challenging to estimate the percentage of NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators that will be used in the treatment of IPPS patients in CY 2023 that will be domestic. The OMB's Made in America Office recently conducted a data call on capacity in which several entities attested to being able to supply 3.6 billion NIOSH-approved and Berry-compliant surgical N95 respirators annually in the future if there were sufficient demand. We recognize that it may take time for this capacity to be fully reflected in hospital purchases. Therefore, although this would be sufficient capacity to supply the entire hospital industry if it were to be available and focused on this segment of the marketplace in 2023, we believe it is reasonable to assume that this will not happen instantaneously and hospitals in aggregate may in fact be able to purchase less than half of their NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators as domestic in 2023. Therefore, for purposes of this IPPS spending estimate, we set the percentage of NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators used in the treatment of IPPS patients in CY 2023 that are domestic to 40 percent, or slightly less than half. We estimate that total CY 2023 IPPS payments associated with this policy will be $3.1 million (or 38.4 million covered days * $0.20 * 40 percent).  Table 110 shows the estimated impact of this final rule with comment period on hospitals. Historically, the first line of the impact table, which estimates the change in payments to all facilities, has always included cancer and children's hospitals, which are held harmless to their pre-Balanced Budget Act (BBA) amount. We also include CMHCs in the first line that includes all providers. We include a second line for all hospitals, excluding permanently held harmless hospitals and CMHCs. We present separate impacts for CMHCs in Table 110, and we discuss them separately below, because CMHCs are paid only for partial hospitalization services under the OPPS and are a different provider type from hospitals. In CY 2023, we are continuing to pay CMHCs for partial hospitalization services under APC 5853 (Partial Hospitalization for CMHCs) and to pay hospitals for partial hospitalization services under APC 5863 (Partial Hospitalization for Hospital-Based PHPs). The estimated increase in the total payments made under the OPPS is determined largely by the increase to the conversion factor under the statutory methodology. The distributional impacts presented do not include assumptions about changes in volume and service-mix. The conversion factor is updated annually by the OPD fee schedule increase factor, as discussed in detail in section II.B of this final rule with comment period. Section 1833(t)(3)(C)(iv) of the Act provides that the OPD fee schedule increase factor is equal to the market basket percentage increase applicable under section 1886(b)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act, which we refer to as the IPPS market basket percentage increase. The IPPS market basket percentage increase applicable to the OPD fee schedule for CY 2023 is 4.1 percent. Section 1833(t)(3)(F)(i) of the Act reduces that 4.1 percent by the productivity adjustment described in section 1886(b)(3)(B)(xi)(II) of the Act, which is 0.3 percentage point for CY 2023 (which is also the productivity adjustment for FY 2023 in the FY 2023 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (87 FR 49056)), resulting in the CY 2023 OPD fee schedule increase factor of 3.8 percent. We are using the OPD fee schedule increase factor of 3.8 percent in the calculation of the CY 2023 OPPS conversion factor. Section 10324 of the Affordable Care Act, as amended by HCERA, further authorized additional expenditures outside budget neutrality for hospitals in certain frontier States that have a wage index less than 1.0000. The amounts attributable to this frontier State wage index adjustment are incorporated in the estimates in Table 110 of this final rule with comment period. To illustrate the impact of the CY 2023 changes, our analysis begins with a baseline simulation model that uses the CY 2022 relative payment weights, the FY 2022 final IPPS wage indexes that include reclassifications, and the final CY 2022 conversion factor. Table 110 shows the estimated redistribution of the increase or decrease in payments for CY 2023 over CY 2022 payments to hospitals and CMHCs as a result of the following factors: the impact of the APC reconfiguration and recalibration changes between CY 2022 and CY 2023 (Column 2); the wage indexes and the provider adjustments (Column 3); the combined impact of all of the changes described in the preceding columns plus the 3.8 percent OPD fee schedule increase factor update to the conversion factor (Column 4); the estimated differential impact of the rural SCH exception to the Off Campus Provider Based Department Visits Policy (Column 5); the estimated impact taking into account all payments for CY 2023 relative to all payments for CY 2022, including the impact of changes in estimated outlier payments, changes to the pass-through payment estimate, the change to except rural sole community hospitals from the clinic visit policy when provided at campus provider based departments, and the payment adjustment for the additional resource costs to hospitals of acquiring domestic NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators (Column 6). We did not model an explicit budget neutrality adjustment for the rural adjustment for SCHs because we are maintaining the current adjustment percentage for CY 2023. Because the updates to the conversion factor (including the update of the OPD fee schedule increase factor), the estimated cost of the rural adjustment, and the estimated cost of projected pass-through payment for CY 2023 are applied uniformly across services, observed redistributions of payments in the impact table for hospitals largely depend on the mix of services furnished by a hospital (for example, how the APCs for the hospital's most frequently furnished services will change), and the impact of the wage index changes on the hospital. However, total payments made under this system and the extent to which this final rule with comment period will redistribute money during implementation also will depend on changes in volume, practice patterns, and the mix of services billed between CY 2022 and CY 2023 by various groups of hospitals, which CMS cannot forecast. Overall, we estimate that the rates for CY 2023 will increase Medicare OPPS payments by an estimated 4.5 percent. Removing payments to cancer and children's hospitals because their payments are held harmless to the pre-OPPS ratio between payment and cost and removing payments to CMHCs results in an estimated 4.7 percent increase in Medicare payments to all other hospitals. These estimated payments will not significantly impact other providers.  Column 2 shows the estimated effect of APC recalibration. Column 2 also reflects any changes in multiple procedure discount patterns or conditional packaging that occur as a result of the changes in the relative magnitude of payment weights. As a result of APC recalibration, we estimate that urban hospitals will experience a 0.1 increase, with the impact ranging from a decrease of 0.2 percent to an increase of 0.5, depending on the number of beds. Rural hospitals will experience an estimated decrease of 0.1 overall. Major teaching hospitals will experience an estimated decrease of 0.3 percent. Column 3 demonstrates the combined budget neutral impact of the APC recalibration; the updates for the wage indexes with the FY 2023 IPPS post-reclassification wage indexes; the rural adjustment; the frontier adjustment, and the cancer hospital payment adjustment. We modeled the independent effect of the budget neutrality adjustments and the OPD fee schedule increase factor by using the relative payment weights and wage indexes for each year, and using a CY 2022 conversion factor that included the OPD fee schedule increase and a budget neutrality adjustment for differences in wage indexes. Column 3 reflects the independent effects of the updated wage indexes, including the application of budget neutrality for the rural floor policy on a nationwide basis, as well as the CY 2023 changes in wage index policy, discussed in section II.C of this final rule with comment period. We did not model a budget neutrality adjustment for the rural adjustment for SCHs because we are continuing the rural payment adjustment of 7.1 percent to rural SCHs for CY 2023, as described in section II.E of this final rule with comment period. We also did not model a budget neutrality adjustment for the proposed cancer hospital payment adjustment because the proposed payment-to-cost ratio target for the cancer hospital payment adjustment in CY 2023 is 0.89, the same as the ratio that was reported for the CY 2022 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (85 FR 85914). We note that, in accordance with section 16002 of the 21st Century Cures Act, we are applying a budget neutrality factor calculated as if the cancer hospital adjustment target payment-to-cost ratio was 0.90, not the 0.89 target payment-to-cost ratio we are applying in section II.F of this final rule with comment period. We modeled the independent effect of updating the wage indexes by varying only the wage indexes, holding APC relative payment weights, service-mix, and the rural adjustment constant and using the CY 2023 scaled weights and a CY 2022 conversion factor that included a budget neutrality adjustment for the effect of the changes to the wage indexes between CY 2022 and CY 2023. Column 4 demonstrates the impact of paying for 340B-acquired drugs at ASP+6 percent and removing the 3.19 percent increase to the conversion factor that was made in CY 2018 to implement the 340B policy in a budget neutral manner. Column 5 demonstrates the combined impact of all of the changes previously described and the update to the conversion factor of 3.8 percent. Overall, these changes will increase payments to urban hospitals by 5.3 percent and to rural hospitals by 2.7 percent. Sole community hospitals receive an estimated increase of 1.7 percent while other rural hospitals receive an estimated increase of 4.3 percent. Column 6 displays the estimated effect of the exception for rural sole community hospitals to the volume control method to pay for clinic visit HCPCS code G0463 (Hospital outpatient clinic visit for assessment and management of a patient) when billed with modifier “PO” by an excepted off-campus PBD at 40 percent of the OPPS rate for a clinic visit service for CY 2023. This exception is estimated to increase payments to rural sole community hospitals by 1.1 percent. Column 7 depicts the full impact of the final CY 2023 policies on each hospital group by including the effect of all changes for CY 2023 and comparing them to all estimated payments in CY 2021. Column 7 shows the combined budget neutral effects of Columns 2 and 3; the OPD fee schedule increase; the impact of estimated OPPS outlier payments, as discussed in section II.G of this final rule with comment period; the change in the Hospital OQR Program payment reduction for the small number of hospitals in our impact model that failed to meet the reporting requirements (discussed in section XIV of this final rule with comment period); the change to except rural sole community hospitals from the clinic visit policy when provided at excepted off-campus provider-based departments, and the adjustment for the additional resource costs of acquiring domestic NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators. Of those hospitals that failed to meet the Hospital OQR Program reporting requirements for the full CY 2022 update (and assumed, for modeling purposes, to be the same number for CY 2023), we included 20 hospitals in our model because they had both CY 2021 claims data and recent cost report data. We estimate that the cumulative effect of all changes for CY 2023 will increase payments to all facilities by 4.5 percent for CY 2022. We modeled the independent effect of all changes in Column 7 using the final relative payment weights for CY 2022 and the final relative payment weights for CY 2023. We used the final conversion factor for CY 2023 of $85.585 and the final CY 2022 conversion factor of $84.177 discussed in section II.B of this final rule with comment period. While the calculation to determine the conversion factor includes the differences between the amounts carved out for pass-through payment in CYs 2022 and 2023, as this change is implemented in a budget neutral manner, we have excluded it from the impact calculations displayed in Table 110 below because it has no estimated overall effect on OPPS total payments.  Overall, we estimate that facilities will experience an increase of 4.5 percent under this final rule in CY 2023 relative to total spending in CY 2022. This projected increase (shown in Column 7) of Table 110 of this final rule with comment period reflects the 3.8 percent OPD fee schedule increase factor, the change to except rural sole community hospitals from the clinic visit policy when provided at excepted off-campus provider-based departments, and the adjustment for the additional resource costs of acquiring domestic NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators, minus the difference in estimated outlier payments between CY 2022 (1.26 percent) and CY 2023 (1.0 percent). We estimate that the combined effect of all changes for CY 2023 will increase payments to urban hospitals by 4.9 percent. Overall, we estimate that rural hospitals will experience a 2.9 percent increase as a result of the combined effects of all the changes for CY 2023. Among hospitals, by teaching status, we estimate that the impacts resulting from the combined effects of all changes will include an increase of 6.8 percent for major teaching hospitals and an increase of 3.1 percent for nonteaching hospitals. Minor teaching hospitals will experience an estimated increase of 4.2 percent. In our analysis, we also have categorized hospitals by type of ownership. Based on this analysis, we estimate that voluntary hospitals will experience an increase of 4.9 percent, proprietary hospitals will experience an increase of 1.3 percent, and governmental hospitals will experience an increase of 5.9 percent. The last line of Table 110 demonstrates the isolated impact on CMHCs, which furnish only partial hospitalization services under the OPPS. In CY 2022, CMHCs are paid under APC 5853 (Partial Hospitalization (3 or more services) for CMHCs). We modeled the impact of this APC policy assuming CMHCs will continue to provide the same number of days of PHP care as seen in the CY 2021 claims used for ratesetting in the final rule. We excluded days with one or two services because our policy only pays a per diem rate for partial hospitalization when three or more qualifying services are provided to the beneficiary. We note that under our final policy, in order to pay appropriately and protect access to PHP services in CMHCs, for CY 2023 but not for subsequent years, we are applying an equitable adjustment, under the authority set forth in section 1833(t)(2)(E) of the Act, to the CY 2023 CMHC APC payment rate by maintaining the CY 2022 CMHC APC payment rate. As a result, we estimate that CMHCs will experience no change in CY 2023 payments relative to their CY 2022 payments.(shown in Column 7). For a detailed discussion of our final PHP policies, please see section VIII of this final rule with comment period. Column 3 shows the estimated impact of adopting the final FY 2023 wage index values which result in an increase of 0.0 percent to CMHCs. Column 4 shows that combining the OPD fee schedule increase factor, along with the final changes in APC policy for CY 2023 and the final FY 2023 wage index updates, will result in an estimated decrease of—3.1 percent. Column 7 reflects no change, per our final policy to maintain the CY 2022 CMHC APC payment rates in CY 2023. For services for which the beneficiary pays a copayment of 20 percent of the payment rate, the beneficiary's payment would increase for services for which the OPPS payments will rise and will decrease for services for which the OPPS payments will fall. For further discussion of the calculation of the national unadjusted copayments and minimum unadjusted copayments, we refer readers to section II.H of this final rule with comment period. In all cases, section 1833(t)(8)(C)(i) of the Act limits beneficiary liability for copayment for a procedure performed in a year to the hospital inpatient deductible for the applicable year. We estimate that the aggregate beneficiary coinsurance percentage would be approximately 18.1 percent for all services paid under the OPPS in CY 2023. The estimated aggregate beneficiary coinsurance reflects general system adjustments, including the Final CY 2023 comprehensive APC payment policy discussed in section II.A.2.b of this final rule with comment period. We note that the individual payments, and therefore copayments, associated with services may differ based on the setting in which they are furnished. However, at the aggregate system level, we do not currently observe significant impact on beneficiary coinsurance as a result of those policies.  The effect on the Medicare program is expected to be an increase of $2.53 billion in program payments for OPPS services furnished in CY 2023. The effect on the Medicaid program is expected to be limited to copayments that Medicaid may make on behalf of Medicaid recipients who are also Medicare beneficiaries. We estimate that the changes in this final rule with comment period will increase these Medicaid beneficiary payments by approximately $150 million in CY 2023. Currently, there are approximately 10 million dual-eligible beneficiaries, which represent approximately 30 percent of Medicare Part B fee-for-service beneficiaries. The impact on Medicaid was determined by taking 30 percent of the beneficiary cost-sharing impact. The national average split of Medicaid payments is 57 percent Federal payments and 43 percent State payments. Therefore, for the estimated $150 million Medicaid increase, approximately $85 million will be from the Federal Government and $65 million will be from State governments. Alternatives to the OPPS changes we proposed and the reasons for our selected alternatives are discussed throughout this final rule with comment period. • Alternatives Considered for the Claims Data used in OPPS and ASC Ratesetting due to the PHE. We refer readers to section X.B of this final rule with comment period for a discussion of our final policy of using cost report data prior to the PHE. We note, in that section we discuss the alternative proposal we considered regarding applying the standard ratesetting process, in particular the selection of cost report data used, which would include claims and cost report data including the timeframe of the PHE. We note that there are potential issues related to that data, including the effect of the PHE on the provider departmental CCRs that would be used to estimate cost. In this final rule with comment period, as discussed in section X.D, we are finalizing a policy of using updated CY 2021 claims data in CY 2023 OPPS ratesetting, while using cost report CCRs with reporting periods prior to the PHE. We note that these policy considerations also have ASC implications since the relative weights for certain surgical procedures performed in the ASC setting are developed based on the OPPS relative weights and claims data. Most ASC payment rates are calculated by multiplying the ASC conversion factor by the ASC relative payment weight. As discussed fully in section XIII of this final rule with comment period, we are setting the CY 2023 ASC relative payment weights by scaling the final CY 2023 OPPS relative payment weights by the final ASC scalar of 0.8594. The estimated effects of the updated relative payment weights on payment rates are varied and are reflected in the estimated payments displayed in Tables 111 and 112. Beginning in CY 2011, section 3401 of the Affordable Care Act requires that the annual update to the ASC payment system (which, in CY 2019, we adopted a policy to be the hospital market basket update for CY 2019 through CY 2023) after application of any quality reporting reduction be reduced by a productivity adjustment. Section 1886(b)(3)(B)(xi)(II) of the Act defines the productivity adjustment to be equal to the 10-year moving average of changes in annual economy-wide private nonfarm business multifactor productivity (as projected by the Secretary for the 10-year period, ending with the applicable fiscal year, year, cost reporting period, or other annual period). For ASCs that fail to meet their quality reporting requirements, the CY 2023 payment determinations would be based on the application of a 2.0 percentage point reduction to the annual update factor, which would be the hospital market basket update for CY 2023. We calculated the CY 2023 ASC conversion factor by adjusting the CY 2022 ASC conversion factor by 1.0008 to account for changes in the pre-floor and pre-reclassified hospital wage indexes between CY 2022 and CY 2023 and by applying the CY 2023 productivity-adjusted hospital market basket update factor of 3.8 percent (which is equal to the projected hospital market basket update of 4.1 percent reduced by a productivity adjustment of 0.3 percentage point). The CY 2023 ASC conversion factor is $51.854 for ASCs that successfully meet the quality reporting requirements. Presented here are the projected effects of the final changes for CY 2023 on Medicare payment to ASCs. A key limitation of our analysis is our inability to predict changes in ASC service-mix between CY 2021 and CY 2023 with precision. We believe the net effect on Medicare expenditures resulting from the final CY 2023 changes will be small in the aggregate for all ASCs. However, such changes may have differential effects across surgical specialty groups, as ASCs continue to adjust to the payment rates based on the policies of the revised ASC payment system. We are unable to accurately project such changes at a disaggregated level. Clearly, individual ASCs would experience changes in payment that differ from the aggregated estimated impacts presented below. Some ASCs are multispecialty facilities that perform a wide range of surgical procedures from excision of lesions to hernia repair to cataract extraction; others focus on a single specialty and perform only a limited range of surgical procedures, such as eye, digestive system, or orthopedic procedures. The combined effect on an individual ASC of the final update to the CY 2023 payments will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the mix of services the ASC provides, the volume of specific services provided by the ASC, the percentage of its patients who are Medicare beneficiaries, and the extent to which an ASC provides different services in the coming year. The following discussion includes tables that display estimates of the impact of the final CY 2023 updates to the ASC payment system on Medicare payments to ASCs, assuming the same mix of services, as reflected in our CY 2021 claims data. Table 111 depicts the estimated aggregate percent change in payment by surgical specialty or ancillary items and services group by comparing estimated CY 2022 payments to estimated CY 2023 payments, and Table 112 shows a comparison of estimated CY 2022 payments to estimated CY 2023 payments for procedures that we estimate would receive the most Medicare payment in CY 2022. In Table 111, we have aggregated the surgical HCPCS codes by specialty group, grouped all HCPCS codes for covered ancillary items and services into a single group, and then estimated the effect on aggregated payment for surgical specialty and ancillary items and services groups. The groups are sorted for display in descending order by estimated Medicare program payment to ASCs. The following is an explanation of the information presented in Table 111.  • Column 2—Estimated CY 2022 ASC Payments were calculated using CY 2021 ASC utilization data (the most recent full year of ASC utilization) and CY 2022 ASC payment rates. The surgical specialty groups are displayed in descending order based on estimated CY 2022 ASC payments. • Column 3—Estimated CY 2023 Percent Change is the aggregate percentage increase or decrease in Medicare program payment to ASCs for each surgical specialty or ancillary items and services group that is attributable to proposed updates to ASC payment rates for CY 2023 compared to CY 2022. As shown in Table 111, for the six specialty groups that account for the most ASC utilization and spending, we estimate that the final update to ASC payment rates for CY 2023 will result in a 3 percent increase in aggregate payment amounts for eye and ocular adnexa procedures, a 4 percent increase in aggregate payment amounts for nervous system procedures, 7 percent increase in aggregate payment amounts for musculoskeletal system procedures, a 5 percent increase in aggregate payment amounts for digestive system procedures, a 2 percent increase in aggregate payment amounts for cardiovascular system procedures, and a 4 percent increase in aggregate payment amounts for genitourinary system procedures. We note that these changes can be a result of different factors, including updated data, payment weight changes, and changes in policy. In general, spending in each of these categories of services is increasing due to the 3.8 percent payment rate update. After the payment rate update is accounted for, aggregate payment increases or decreases for a category of services can be higher or lower than a 3.8 percent increase, depending on if payment weights in the OPPS APCs that correspond to the applicable services increased or decreased or if the most recent data show an increase or a decrease in the volume of services performed in an ASC for a category. For example, we estimate a 7 percent increase in aggregate musculoskeletal procedure payments. The increase in payment rates for musculoskeletal procedures as a result of increased OPPS relative weights and device portions is further increased by the 3.8 percent ASC rate update for these procedures. Conversely, we estimate only a 3 percent increase in aggregate eye and ocular adnexa procedures related to a decrease in OPPS relative weights partially offsetting the 3.8 percent ASC rate update. For estimated changes for selected procedures, we refer readers to Table 111 provided later in this section. Table 111 shows the estimated impact of the updates to the revised ASC payment system on aggregate ASC payments for selected surgical procedures during CY 2023. The table displays 30 of the procedures receiving the greatest estimated CY 2022 aggregate Medicare payments to ASCs. The HCPCS codes are sorted in descending order by estimated CY 2022 program payment. • Column 1—CPT/HCPCS code. • Column 2—Short Descriptor of the HCPCS code. • Column 3—Estimated CY 2022 ASC Payments were calculated using CY 2021 ASC utilization (the most recent full year of ASC utilization) and the CY 2022 ASC payment rates. The estimated CY 2022 payments are expressed in millions of dollars. • Column 4—Estimated CY 2023 Percent Change reflects the percent differences between the estimated ASC payment for CY 2022 and the estimated payment for CY 2023 based on the final update.  https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/assets/OMB/circulars/a004/a-4.html We refer readers to the CY 2018 OPPS/ASC final rule (82 FR 59492 through 59494) for the previously estimated effects of changes to the Hospital Outpatient Quality Reporting (OQR) Program for the CY 2018, CY 2019, and CY 2021 payment determinations. Of the 3,356 hospitals that met eligibility requirements for the CY 2022 payment determination, we determined that 88 hospitals did not meet the requirements to receive the full annual Outpatient Department (OPD) fee schedule increase factor. We do not anticipate that the CY 2023 Hospital OQR Program policies will impact the number of facilities that will receive payment reductions. In this final rule with comment period, we are finalizing to: (1) add an additional targeting criterion to the validation selection policy beginning with the CY 2023 reporting period; (2) align the patient encounter quarters with the calendar year beginning with the CY 2024 reporting period; and (3) change reporting for the OP-31 measure from mandatory to voluntary beginning with the CY 2025 payment determination.  In section XV of this final rule with comment period, we discuss our finalized policies affecting the Ambulatory Surgical Center Quality Reporting (ASCQR) Program. For the CY 2022 payment determination, of the 5,386 ASCs that met eligibility requirements, we determined that 290 ASCs did not meet the requirements to receive the full annual payment update under the ASC fee schedule. In section XVI of this final rule with comment period, we are finalizing to change the reporting for the ASC-11 measure from mandatory to voluntary beginning with the CY 2023 reporting period. As shown in Table 105 in section XXIII.C.3.e (Collection of Information) of this final rule with comment period, we estimate a total information collection burden decrease for 4,646 ACSs of −72,107 hours at a cost of −$3,350,091 annually associated with our finalized policies and updated burden estimates for the CY 2025 reporting period/CY 2027 payment determination and subsequent years, compared to our currently approved information collection burden estimates. We refer readers to section XXIII.C of this final rule with comment period (information collection requirements) for a detailed discussion of the calculations estimating the changes to the information collection burden for submitting data to the ASCQR Program. We do not believe the finalized policy will have any further economic impact beyond information collection burden. In section XVIII.A of this final rule with comment period, we discuss our finalized policies to provide payment to REHs, including the following finalized proposals: (1) the payment rate for an REH service would be calculated using the OPPS prospective payment rate for the equivalent covered OPD service increased by 5 percent; (2) the additional 5 percent payment for REH services, above the amount that would be paid for covered OPD services, would not be subject to a copayment; (3) for CY 2023, the monthly facility payment that each REH will receive would be determined by first calculating the total amount that CMS determines was paid to all CAHs under Title 18 of the Act in CY 2019 minus the estimated total amount that would have been paid under Title 18 to CAHs in CY 2019 if payment were made for inpatient hospital, outpatient hospital, and skilled nursing facility services under the applicable prospective payment systems for such services during CY 2019. The difference is divided by the number of CAHs enrolled in Medicare in CY 2019 to calculate the annual amount of this additional facility payment per individual REH. The annual payment amount is then divided by 12 to calculate the monthly facility payment that each REH will receive.   We developed a percentile analysis estimating how much revenue from rendering medical services a provider would lose or gain during CY 2023 if it decided to convert to a REH. We estimated that a provider in the 95th percentile of total annual REH medical service payment would receive an additional $2,089,700 in Medicare payments. We estimated that a provider in the 100th percentile of total annual REH medical service payment would receive an additional $3,362,560 in Medicare payments. Since a REH provider conversion rate of 4 percent falls between the 95th percentile and the 100th percentile of total annual REH medical service payment spending, we took the average of the additional spending for the 95th and 100th percentiles to determine the additional medical service spending for each provider converting to a REH in CY 2023 would be $2,726,130. Since we do not have any information on individual providers that may convert, nor do we have any information on characteristics of regions where REH conversions may be more likely, our best assumption regarding the impact of the REH policy is that providers who anticipate the most financial benefit from converting to an REH would be the most likely providers to convert. Next, we determined the annual facility payment amount for a provider that converts to an REH in CY 2023. The finalized monthly facility payment for CY 2023 is $272,866. When this amount is multiplied by 12 months, the total annual facility payment is equal to $3,274,392. To determine the total impacts of the REH policy, we need to multiply the additional medical service spending amount of $2,726,130 by 68 providers which equals $185,376,820. Next, we multiply the total annual facility payment amount of $3,274,392 by 68 providers which equals $222, 658, 656. Finally, we combine the two amounts together, and we obtain a final estimate of the impacts of the REH provider policy of an additional $408,035,476 in Medicare payments.  The only impacts of our finalized REH enrollment policies are the information collection requirements associated with the facility's completion and submission of a Form CMS-855A change of information application to convert from a CAH or hospital (as defined in section 1886(d)(1)(B) of the Act) to an REH. These are addressed in detail in section XXIII.G of this final rule with comment period. As explained in that section, we estimate a Year 1 burden of 68 hours (68 applications × 1 hour per application) at a cost of $2,784 (based on an hourly wage estimate of $40.94).   In accordance with §\\u2009419.83(b), we are finalizing our proposal to require prior authorization for a new service category: Facet joint interventions. We are adding the service category to §\\u2009419.83(a)(3). We are also requiring that the prior authorization process for the additional service category will be effective for dates of services on or after July 1, 2023. The addition of the service category is consistent with our authority under section 1833(t)(2)(F) of the Act and is based upon our determination that there has been an unnecessary increase in the volume of these services. The overall economic impact on the health care sector to require prior authorization for the additional service category is dependent on the number of claims affected. Table 116, Overall Economic Impact on the Health Sector, lists an estimate of the overall economic impact on the health sector for the new service category. The values populating this table were obtained from the cost reflected in Table 117, Annual Private Sector Costs, and Table 118, Estimated Annual Administrative Costs to CMS. Together, Tables 117 and 118 combine to convey the overall economic cost impact to the health sector for the new service category, which is illustrated in Table 116. It should be noted that due to the July start date for prior authorization for the new service category, year one includes only 6 months of prior authorization requests. Based on the estimate, the overall economic cost impact is approximately $13.3 million in the first year based on 6 months for the new service category. The 5-year impact is approximately $118.7 million, and the 10-year impact is approximately $250.4 million. The 5- and 10-year impacts account for year one, including only 6 months. Additional administrative paperwork costs to private sector providers and an increase in Medicare spending to conduct reviews combine to create the financial impact; however, this impact is offset by Medicare savings. Annually, we estimate an overall Medicare savings of $65.3 million. We believe there are likely to be other benefits that result from the prior authorization requirement for the new service category, though many of those benefits are difficult to quantify. For instance, we expect to see savings in the form of reduced unnecessary utilization, fraud, waste, and abuse, including a reduction in improper Medicare fee-for-service payments (we note that not all improper payments are fraudulent). We solicited public comments on the potential increased costs and benefits associated with this proposed provision for the new service category.  We do not believe that this rule will significantly affect the number of legitimate claims submitted for the new service category. However, we do expect a decrease in the overall amount paid for the services resulting from a reduction in unnecessary utilization of the services requiring prior authorization. We estimate that the private sector's per-case time burden attributed to submitting documentation and associated clerical activities in support of a prior authorization request for the additional service category will be equivalent to that of submitting documentation and clerical activities associated with prepayment review, which is 0.5 hours. We apply this time burden estimate to initial submissions and resubmissions. CMS will incur additional costs associated with processing the prior authorization requests for the new service category. We use the range of potentially affected cases (submissions and resubmissions) and multiply it by $50, the estimated cost to review each request. The combined cost also includes other elements such as appeals, education, outreach, and system changes. We expect a reduction in the utilization of the new Medicare OPD service category when such utilization does not comply with one or more of Medicare's coverage, coding, and payment rules. While there may be an associated burden on beneficiaries while they wait for the prior authorization decision; we are unable to quantify that burden. Although the rule permits utilization that is medically necessary, OPD services that are not medically necessary may still provide convenience or usefulness for beneficiaries; any rule-induced loss of such convenience or usefulness constitutes a cost of the rule that we lack data to quantify. Additionally, beneficiaries may have out-of-pocket costs for those services that are determined not to comply with Medicare requirements and thus, are not eligible for Medicare payment. We lack the data to quantify these costs as well. There will be quantifiable benefits for this rule because we expect a reduction in the unnecessary utilization of the new Medicare OPD service category subject to prior authorization. It is difficult to project the exact decrease in unnecessary utilization; however, based on a 25 percent savings percentage, we estimate that for the first 6 months, there will be savings of $32.6 million overall. Annually, we estimate an overall gross savings of $65.3 million. These savings represent a Medicare benefit from more efficient use of health care resources while still maintaining the same health outcomes for necessary services. We will closely monitor utilization and billing practices. The expected benefits will also include changed billing practices that would also enhance the coordination of care for the beneficiary. For example, requiring prior authorization for the additional OPD services category will ensure that the primary care practitioner recommending the service and the facility collaborate more closely to provide the most appropriate OPD services to meet the needs of the beneficiary. The practitioner recommending the service would evaluate the beneficiary to determine what services are medically necessary based on the beneficiary's condition. This would require the facility to collaborate closely with the practitioner early on in the process to ensure the services are truly necessary and meet all requirements and that their supporting documentation is complete and correct. Improper payments made because the practitioner did not evaluate the patient or the patient does not meet the Medicare requirements will likely be reduced by the requirement that a provider submits clinical documentation created as part of its prior authorization request. This final rule with comment period addresses the CoPs required for REH designation, which in accordance with the statute, may be sought by CAHs and small rural hospitals. It also finalizes several new CAH requirements that we believe are appropriate under the existing program as well as to REHs. However, note that the costs of these CAH requirements are not attributable to the new REH program (except where such costs are experienced by entities that remain open due to the REH option but would have closed otherwise). The baseline for the estimates of REH costs is the status quo had the new program had not been created. The final CoPs for the new REH provider type are similar to those already met by the facilities that will potentially convert to REH status, and for collection of information purposes we did not subtract offsetting savings from providers who would already meet these standards and who decide to make little change when updating their status.  If regulations impose administrative costs on private entities, such as the time needed to read and interpret this rule, we should estimate the cost associated with regulatory review. Due to the uncertainty involved with accurately quantifying the number of entities that will review the rule, we assumed that the number of commenters on this year's proposed rule will be the number of reviewers of this final rule. We acknowledge that this assumption may understate or overstate the costs of reviewing this rule. It is possible that not all commenters reviewed this year's proposed rule in detail, and it is also possible that some reviewers choose not to comment on the proposed rule. For these reasons, we thought that the number of commenters on the CY 2023 OPPS/ASC proposed rule would be a fair estimate of the number of reviewers of this final rule. We also recognize that different types of entities are, in many cases, affected by mutually exclusive sections of the proposed rule, and therefore, for the purposes of our estimate, we assume that each reviewer reads approximately 50 percent of the rule. https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm https://www.sba.gov/content/table-small-business-size-standards In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act requires us to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a rule may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis must conform to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital as a hospital that is located outside of a metropolitan statistical area and has 100 or fewer beds. We estimate that this final rule with comment period will increase payments to small rural hospitals by approximately 2.5 percent. Therefore, it should not have a significant impact on the approximately 549 small rural hospitals. We note that the estimated payment impact for any category of small entity will depend on both the services that they provide as well as the payment policies and/or payment systems that may apply to them. Therefore, the most applicable estimated impact may be based on the specialty, provider type, or payment system. The analysis above, together with the remainder of this preamble, provides a regulatory flexibility analysis and a regulatory impact analysis. We note that the policies established in this rule apply more broadly to OPPS providers and do not specifically focus on small rural hospitals. As a result, the impact on those providers may depend more significantly on their case mix of services provided, since the broader impact on the hospital category is more dependent on the OPD update factor, as indicated in the impact table. Section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) also requires that agencies assess anticipated costs and benefits before issuing any rule whose mandates require spending in any 1 year of $100 million in 1995 dollars, updated annually for inflation. In 2022, that threshold level is currently approximately $165 million. This final rule with comment period does not mandate any requirements for State, local, or tribal governments, or for the private sector. The changes we are finalizing in this final rule with comment period will affect all classes of hospitals paid under the OPPS as well as affect both CMHCs and ASCs. We estimate that most classes of hospitals paid under the OPPS would experience a modest increase or a minimal decrease in payment for services furnished under the OPPS in CY 2023. Table 110 demonstrates the estimated distributional impact of the OPPS budget neutrality requirements that will result in a 4.5 percent increase in payments for all services paid under the OPPS in CY 2023, after considering all of the changes to APC reconfiguration and recalibration, as well as the OPD fee schedule increase factor, wage index changes, including the frontier State wage index adjustment, estimated payment for outliers, changes to the pass-through payment estimate, exception for rural SCHs from the clinic visit policy for services furnished at off campus PBDs, and adjustment for the additional resource costs of acquiring domestic NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators. However, some classes of providers that are paid under the OPPS will experience more significant gains or losses in OPPS payments in CY 2023.  Executive Order 13132 establishes certain requirements that an agency must meet when it promulgates a proposed rule (and subsequent final rule) that imposes substantial direct costs on State and local governments, preempts State law, or otherwise has federalism implications. We have examined the OPPS and ASC provisions included in this final rule with comment period in accordance with Executive Order 13132, Federalism, and have determined that they will not have a substantial direct effect on State, local, or tribal governments, preempt State law, or otherwise have a federalism implication. As reflected in Table 110 of this final rule with comment period, we estimate that OPPS payments to governmental hospitals (including State and local governmental hospitals) will increase by 5.9 percent under this final rule with comment period. While we do not know the number of ASCs or CMHCs with government ownership, we anticipate that it is small. The analyses we have provided in this section of this final rule with comment period, in conjunction with the remainder of this document, demonstrate that this final rule with comment period is consistent with the regulatory philosophy and principles identified in Executive Order 12866, the RFA, and section 1102(b) of the Act. This final rule with comment period will affect payments to a substantial number of small rural hospitals and a small number of rural ASCs, as well as other classes of hospitals, CMHCs, and ASCs, and some effects may be significant. However, as noted in section XXIII of this final rule with comment period, this rule should not have a significant effect on small rural hospitals. et seq.
